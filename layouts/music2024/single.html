      Holy. Shit. They did it. They made the perfect Blood Incantation album.
      Only Blood Incantation can do such a thing. Possibly the most polarizing
      death metal band to date (are there other polarizing death metal bands?)
      When they released Timewave Zero (a pure ambient album), there was a
      definite divide in fans that loved it or hated it. Back in 2023 there was
      talk about the band recording with members of Hallas at Hansa Tonstudio in
      Berlin. Then Luminescent Bridge was released, but it seemed this was an
      unrelated single, one side death metal, the other ambient. The guys were
      cooking something else. A full length LP was finally announced this year,
      and I don't think anybody was ready. They blended ambient and psychedelic
      rock with multiple sub-genres of metal in such a way that no actual fan
      could be mad about. It features Thorsten Quaesching from Tangerine Dream
      on synths, and if that isn't enough, Nicklas Malmqvist from Hallas is also
      on keys. There's a portion of The Message (Tablet II) that will make you
      feel like you've been immediately transported into a 70s Pink Floyd album
      before being dropped into some of the best thrash metal to bless your ear
      holes. This album is a pure masterpiece, and I have a hunch they will push
      it even further.
