  - title: "Les Moontunes - Elephant Wizard"
    content: "A perfect fusion of progressive rock, soul and...heavy jazz? I kinda sorta joked that this was already my album of the year back in January. It's super good."

  - title: "1999 WRITE THE FUTURE - hella (˃̣̣̥╭╮˂̣̣̥) ✧ ♡ ‧º·˚:"
    content: "I have no idea why more people aren't talking about this album. Every song is different, yet the album as a whole is cohesive. The features throughout are mind-blowing, and I love some of the interludes. It's so fresh and creative yet kind of familiar at the same time. If you love hip hop, soul, jazz and funk, this is one-hundred percent for you."

  - title: "Allie X - Girl With No Face"
    content: "Eighties inspired disco synth-pop at it's best. It's banger after banger with this record."

  - title: "Curta'n Wall - Yr Gwyddbwll"
    content: "I still don't know how to explain Curta'n Wall properly. When I do explain the sound, it makes no sense unless you listen to it. Medieval folk music with a little black metal thrown in, and some dungeon synth for good measure. Sounds crazy, but it works!"

  - title: "Jamie xx - In Waves"
    content: "I didn't think we'd wait this long for a new record from Jamie, but boy was it worth it. It's kind of perfect in every way. I just wish it were a bit longer, because by the time the whole album was released, almost half of it in singles were out. But really, who cares? I love it."
    favorite: "The whole damn album. But, let's go with Life, because Robyn."

  - title: "DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ - Hex"
    content: "Would you believe that this two-hour journey is actually the _shortest_ DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ album? By a lot, too. I think this is the best one, so far. The whole album is one big mix and it's pretty incredible (there's also an unmixed version that was released later.) I don't think anyone knows of her actual origin, and I like that. Let's just say it really is Sabrina Spellman and she's an absolute house music _Queen_."

  - title: "Greg Foat - The Glass Frog"
    content: "I can't exactly remember how I came across this album, but how could you see that cover and not check it out? The type, the _actual glass frog_. The opening track, _Sea of Tranquility_ literally sounds like a _sea of tranquility_. This might be one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard. It makes me want to learn piano just to one day have a reason to own a Fender Rhodes."

  - title: "Caribou - Honey"
    content: "I love it when there's a new Caribou album, because this isn't an artist I ever read up on or hear rumors about new releases. So when a new album drops, it's a complete surprise, and I get very excited because I _know_ it's going to be incredible. _Honey_ is fantastic addition to the already amazing Caribou catalog. Doesn't Over Now sound like Discovery-era Daft Punk remixed a Caribou song? I love it. Actually, a few parts of this album sound Discovery-era Daft Punk inspired."

  - title: "Neon Nightmare - Faded Dream"
    content: "When 20 Buck Spin announced this release on their Instagram account, I was immediately drawn to the album art. It very much reminded me of Type O Negative's album covers, but mostly just the typography. I've never listened to enough Type O Negative to call this album completely inspired by them, but after reading other reviews, and sharing it with friends, it seems that this was the intended direction of the project. Heavily inspired by another artist or not, this is a solid listen start to finish. I've never skipped a track. Whether you need to fill that Type O Negative void in your heart, or just want some damn good metal to listen to, I don't think you could go wrong here."
