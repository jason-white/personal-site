    content: "A perfect fusion of progressive rock, soul and...heavy jazz? I kinda sorta joked that this was already my album of the year back in January. It's super good."

    content: "I have no idea why more people aren't talking about this album. Every song is different, yet the album as a whole is cohesive. The features throughout are mind-blowing. Budos Band, Surprise Chef, BADBADNOTGOOD, Ghostface Killah, Rick Ross, and Busta Rhymes to name a few. It's so fresh and creative yet kind of familiar at the same time. If you love hip hop, soul, jazz and funk, this is 100% for you. I listened to this album for probably the whole first half of 2024."

    content: "Eighties inspired disco synth-pop at it's best. It's banger after banger with this record. Really wish I had gone to her show when she came through Charlotte. Hoping that she tours again soon."

    content: "What an absolute stunner. This sounds like early Alcest, but with all the years of experience behind it. A perfect Alcest album, in my opinion. The balance between shoegaze and black metal is just right. It's so light, bright and airy while still pummeling you with a massive wall of sound. Everyone should listen to this, even if you're not into black metal. <s>I want to see them live so bad at this point, I'm willing to travel to Europe for it</s> They're coming to the US in 2025."

    content: "I can't exactly remember how I came across this album, but how could you see that cover and not check it out? The type, the _actual glass frog_. The opening track, _Sea of Tranquility_ literally sounds like a _sea of tranquility_. This might be one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard. It makes me want to learn piano just to one day have a reason to own a Fender Rhodes."

    content: "This is a combination of the three EPs that BADBADNOTGOOD released throughout the year. Some stellar jazz, but would you expect anything less from this band? There seems to be a good bit of South American influences throughout each EP. Definitely my favorite work by them to date. You can tell a lot of love, time and effort went into this one."

    content: "I think this is my favorite album of hers, so far. The whole album is one big mix and it's pretty incredible (there's also an unmixed version that was released later.) I don't know who she actually is, and I like that. Let's just say it really is Sabrina Spellman and she's an absolute house music Queen."

By the time the whole album was released, almost half of the singles were out. Like his last album, I don't think any of these tracks could be played out, anyway. The production and features is all just bonkers good."

    content: "I still don't know how to explain Curta'n Wall properly. When I do explain the sound, it makes no sense unless you listen to it. Medieval folk music with a little black metal thrown in, and some dungeon synth for good measure? The way it's all tied together is genius, really. And, the production on this album is even better than the last."

    content: "I love it when there's a new Caribou album, because he isn't an artist I ever read up on or hear rumors about. So when a new album drops, it's a complete surprise, and I get very excited because I _know_ it's going to be incredible. _Honey_ is fantastic addition to the already amazing Caribou catalog. _Over Now_ sounds like Discovery-era Daft Punk remixed a Caribou song. I love it. Actually, a few parts of this album sound Discovery-era Daft Punk inspired. I mean that in the best possible way."

  - title: "Blood Incantation - Absolute Elsewhere"
    content: "That's it. It's over. Blood Incantation made the greatest psychedelic ambient death metal album ever. It's probably the only psychedelic ambient death metal album. Even still, the bar is _high_. Back in 2023 there was talk about the band recording with members of Hällas at Hansa Studio in Berlin. Then Luminescent Bridge was released, but it seemed this was unrelated to whatever was being done in Berlin. One side death metal, the other an ambient track, Luminescent Bridge was more of a continuation of what we've heard previously. The guys were cooking something else. Absolute Elsewhere was unleashed, and I don't think anybody was ready. They successfully created a blend of ambient music and psychedelic rock with multiple sub-genres of metal. It does feature Nicklas Malmqvist from Hällas, but also freakin' Thorsten Quaesching from Tangerine Dream! It's an amazing record, and I firmly believe they will push it even further with the next release."

    content: "When 20 Buck Spin announced this release on their Instagram account, I was immediately drawn to the album art. It very much reminded me of Type O Negative's album covers, but just the typography, really. I've never listened to enough Type O Negative to call this album completely inspired by them, but after reading other reviews, and sharing it with friends, it seems that this was the intended direction of the project. Heavily inspired by another artist or not, this is a solid listen start to finish. I've never skipped a track. Whether you need to fill that Type O Negative void in your heart, or just want some damn good metal to listen to, I don't think you could go wrong here."

    content: "I don't know where these guys came from, but since this album was suggested, it has been on repeat. A steaming hot bowl of electronic music soup, featuring all sorts of styles like UK garage, dub, and techno. I love how they use vocal samples. It's unique, and gives the album its own character. Also, that album art is crazy."
