        - Uplift Commercial standing desk with a 6' butcher block countertop. I love this way more than I thought I would. So much room for activities!
        - Old Eames Aluminum Group chair. I've sat in this chair almost every day for 15+ years. Still going strong for a 1986 model.
        - LG 5k display. It's kinda busted, but work gave it to me for free. I still want a Studio Display, but this is fine. Apple should make a 27" XDR.
        - Vivo rigid single-arm monitor mount. I've tried multiple articulating monitor arms and disliked all of them. This one is cheap and simple.
