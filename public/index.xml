      <description>Much earlier this year my friend Ryan asked me what seemed, at the time, a very random question:
 Do you guys want to go see Deadmau5 in DC the weekend after Thanksgiving?
 I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to think at first as far as seeing Deadmau5 live, goes. But a trip to DC always sounds like a good time.
There ended up being eight of us and we decided to rent a shuttle van to make the trip up, which everyone agrees was a fantastic idea.</description>
