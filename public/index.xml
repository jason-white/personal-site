          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Slept in again, and almost missed Drag Brunch at the Social Club. The food was pretty good, the entertainment wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, either. The host was a queen from America, going by the name of Rachel Intervention. The Social Club itself is a really cool and unique establishment. Very colorful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headed back to the apartment to nap before going out again. It&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday and not a lot of businesses are open. We ate at some poke bowl place that looked like a chain of sorts. There were a lot of options and it was very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonights event was Unshaved, another bear dance party. This time at Gretchen Club. Our cab driver dropped us off in this very abandoned looking gravel parking lot. She even asked &amp;ldquo;are you sure&amp;rdquo;, to which we replied &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;yeah&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s around here. Somewhere.&amp;rdquo; And it was, but to be honest the whole area at night looked abandoned. There were a couple of mechanics garages, definitely (maybe?) an abandoned grocery store, and then the building we would line up to get into. I&amp;rsquo;m exaggerating a little, but it was dark and I&amp;rsquo;m a tourist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived early since we did not have tickets. Worst case was we go back to WOOF if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in. Well, we did get in, and I had a blast. I danced for 4 hours straight. I never dance. Ever. This may have been the most fun night out I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I made a 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;playlist of every single song that was played while we were there (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71D1n29INCejCtMGhcxNfs?si=5df4173a188e49bd&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    playlist of every single song that was played while we were there
&lt;/a&gt;

, except for maybe one or two obscure remixes, but I improvised. I think only one song wasn&amp;rsquo;t on Spotify at all.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We slept in a bit as the previous day wiped us out. Had a good sized brunch before doing a 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;guided queer history tour (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;http://sonderweg-berlin.de/en/our-tours/all-tours/queer-schoeneberg/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    guided queer history tour
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
 in &lt;span lang=&#34;de&#34;&gt;Schöneberg&lt;/span&gt; tour. Our guide Tobias is a walking encyclopedia of the area. A lot of the tour showed and talked about how the rise of the Nazis and WWI shaped queer life in Berlin. Very much recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point we came to this walled garden that looked to be very Japanese-inspired. I admit I kind of tuned out the tour and just started taking photos of this wall (and door. More doors!) Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span lang=&#34;de&#34;&gt;Das Kleine Grosz Museum&lt;/span&gt; (The Small Grosz Museum), which seems to be 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;a small museum dedicated to George Grosz&amp;#39; work (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.daskleinegroszmuseum.berlin/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    a small museum dedicated to George Grosz&amp;#39; work
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
. And boy do I regret not visiting later. Next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we explored &lt;span lang=&#34;de&#34;&gt;Schöneberg&lt;/span&gt; and the shops. Berlin (and probably most other European cities with a scene) have &lt;em&gt;legit&lt;/em&gt; gear shops. There were so many leather men outfitted head to toe. I think I might be into leather. Tried on a shirt and it kinda felt right. Goes to Berlin once&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had dinner at &lt;span lang=&#34;it&#34;&gt;Da Lucia&lt;/span&gt; again which is sandwiched between Prinzknecht (a leather/gear bar) and WOOF (a bear bar), so the outdoor seating was a mixture of leather men in full gear, groups of pups, bears, and straight couples. I had Spaghetti Bolognese this time, and would definitely have it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short side note of something I observed a few times in Berlin. Dogs are rarely on a leash, which I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with, &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, I have never seen more well-behaved dogs. They always stayed by their owners. We even saw a lady go into a grocery store, and her dog stopped at the door, sat down, and waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at dinner, an older, well-dressed gentlemen, rode up on his bike. There were a lot of well-dressed older people on bikes (just another observation.) Anyway, he had a small dog in his bike&amp;rsquo;s basket. He placed the dog on the ground and it went with him to their table. A little later, completely on it&amp;rsquo;s own, I see the small dog walk over to a tree on the sidewalk. The dog relieves himself on the dirt, not the tree or the sidewalk, and then just walks back over to his owner and lays down. Children aren&amp;rsquo;t even that well-behaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOOF was &lt;em&gt;packed&lt;/em&gt;. Was sweating my butt off in there. We met some nice guys. I was chatting with a nice ozzie gent for a while about his leather suit. He had to be dying in all that, but seemed comfortable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun night, even though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really move for hours. Everyone is super nice.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Day two in Berlin, and it was a good one. Firstly brunch. We checked out a cafe named Refinery on our way to the Alte Nationalgalerie. So far the best coffee on the trip. Still not on par with what I&amp;rsquo;m used to, but it was better than the typical dark roast espresso you get most places here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;museum island (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Island&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

, taking photos along the way. I took a lot of photos of doors and Vespas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Alte Nationalgalerie (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/alte-nationalgalerie/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Alte Nationalgalerie
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
 is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;. The museum mostly features German artists (a lot of Adolph Menzel&amp;rsquo;s work), as expected, however, there&amp;rsquo;s a gallery upstairs sandwiched between two other rooms, featuring some heavy-hitting French painters. The walls were full of Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Cézanne and others. Very happy we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was off to see 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;VEKTOR (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vektor.art/en/ueber&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    VEKTOR
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
, the highlight of the day for me. VEKTOR is an audiovisual installation by Christopher Bauder. It was held at 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Kraftwerk (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://kraftwerkberlin.de/en/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

, a gutted industrial building. The space was like something out of a movie. The piece itself was massive, jaw-dropping and incredibly immersive. We watched a full loop, which was roughly 40 minutes? I swear it felt more like 15. Bauder even created the music. Major shout out to Ryan for telling us about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made it back to the apartment to get ready quick-like for dinner at Sorrel. By far the best dinner of the trip. It was almost like tapas, but the plates were a little larger. I think we ordered everything on the menu. It was all super good. The standouts for me were the hokkaido and the fennel salad. So much flavor! With dessert I got a shot of espresso, and this will hold as the best coffee of the trip. Also, I learned of Acme flatware and cups, and will be ordering some for the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close the night we went to Easter Bear Dance. It was a lot of fun, the music was good and the crowd was pretty great. The venue was cool. It looks to be a music venue most of the time. They had some pretty amazing metal flyers for upcoming shows. Would definitely go back.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Slept in, as expected. We had quite a day planned so there was no time for dillying &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; dallying, no. We showered up and popped over to a cafe a couple of doors down. The coffee was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then walked over the Spree river via the Spreebrücke Bahnhof Friedrichstraße, a bridge underneath the 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Friedrichstraße train station (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe_station&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

. We were headed to Ama&amp;rsquo;s Cafe for brunch. The food was good. I had a salmon and avocado bagel with a coffee. The coffee was kinda meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided now would be a good time to hit a grocery store before taking on the rest of our itinerary for the day. There was an Aldi on the way back. I absolutely had to grab one of these cute, tiny shopping buggies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1712435570/2024%20Posts/2024-03-28_first-full-day-berlin/untitled-25.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropped off groceries, and then it was time to visit the 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Schwules Museum (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.schwulesmuseum.de/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

, an LGBT museum located just north of Schöneberg. The current exhibit covers the history of sex work in Berlin. I think the rest of the gallery towards the back of the space is their permanent collection, but I could be wrong. Some very interesting pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1712435562/2024%20Posts/2024-03-28_first-full-day-berlin/untitled-43.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I forgot to mention this in my offline journal, but we made it over to this Japanese denim shop, 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;DC4 (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://dc4.de/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

. I&amp;rsquo;ve never set foot in a place like this. The space alone was really cool. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit of a denim head for many years. I knew of every brand they carried, but it was so cool to see some of these pieces in person. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning on buying anything, but I saw this really cool t-shirt from Samurai Jeans that was extremely heavy weight for a t-shirt. It was made from their own cotton fields in Japan. Very slubby in texture. I love it. The guy running the shop was very polite and informative. I will be back, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent too much time at DC4, so we had to quickly head back to the apartment to get ready for the 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Nürnberger Symphony at the Berlin Philharmonic (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.berliner-philharmoniker.de/en/concerts/calendar/details/55552/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

. &lt;em&gt;Stunning&lt;/em&gt; venue. Inside and out. A wonderful experience and is something that Mitch and I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done on our own, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad Brian and Jeremie wanted to go. I was not supposed to take that photo, so 🤫.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end the night we went to 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;The Lounge (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/berzt-the-ritz-carlton-berlin/dining/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

 inside of the Ritz-Carlton. We were not aware it was inside of the hotel until we got there. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I was dressed up a little. Otherwise I would have felt very out of place. They had some wonderful mocktails on the menu. The two that I had were so delicious. A mango chili something something, and a berry lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good first day.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Tuesday kind of blends into Wednesday because we time traveled into the future via Airbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all piled into a cab to our AirBnB, and quickly decided on a place to eat. We were dead-tired, but needed food. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice Italian place Jeremie found, called Da Lucia, at the northern edge of 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Schöneberg (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6neberg&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a small observation, but everyone in the restaurant was eating their pizza with a fork and knife. They didn&amp;rsquo;t slice it for you. I was starving, so of course I cut my pie into quarters and inhaled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da Lucia is right beside WOOF, a bear bar, so we decided to check it out. It opened at 9:00pm and within less than 30 minutes it started to fill up. We didn&amp;rsquo;t stay long, as we all needed some much deserved sleep. We met two other Americans. They both met at the airport while flying from Amsterdam (I think?) Adam and Duke. We would end up seeing both of them throughout the week at various events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went back to the apartment around 10:00pm and crashed &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re talking next level sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The whole day was basically trying to finalize packing, make sure the house is tidy, and schedule a Lyft to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight from Charlotte to Munich wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely awful. The food was pretty good. I had curry chicken. I got a lot less studying for my accessibility certification done than I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. Read some Dune and watched Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1712315851/2024%20Posts/2024-03-26_charlotte-to-munic-to-berlin/untitled-4.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt sick at the very end of the flight. Likely due to the heat on the plane. There was absolutely no AC for over eight hours. A woman a few rows up had to be given oxygen, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s related to the temperature. I didn&amp;rsquo;t throw up or anything, and it all went away after landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich airport is very quiet. There were still a lot of people around, but it was just&amp;hellip;pleasantly quiet. The Charlotte airport was complete chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the shuttle to our next gate and had plenty of time. The flight to Berlin was more comfy than the Airbus, and was less than an hour or so. We tried to nap in the Berlin airport (it was also very quiet), while waiting for Brian and Jeremie&amp;rsquo;s flight from Paris to land. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t arrive for another two to three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The photo and title are unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to redesign this site for a while now, and finally started to do so. At least three different ideas were almost fully realized and then scrapped. I am very bad about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was digging in, though, I started to notice that I was doing some things &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; in Hugo (the static site generator that builds this page.) I also started to notice a lot of accessibility issues. Nothing major, but there were a couple of things I was not doing and a couple of things I was doing that wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the other day I decided to (once again) scrap all of the styles, but this time purposefully set up a very simple layout to get started on fixing things from the inside out. This worked well, and now the site is in a usable state. I can start making posts again and stop worrying about how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-things-so-far&#34;&gt;Some things so far&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jasonwhite.us/now&#34;&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; pages a section of posts. Mainly for archiving, organization and maybe RSS. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure on this. Maybe it should just be its own page, but I like the idea of archiving too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made &lt;a href=&#34;https://jasonwhite.us/links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; a section of posts rather than using Pinboard. The idea here is to roll them into RSS. Either one big RSS feed or separate everything into individual feeds. Or both!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Hugo menus properly so that I can add them anywhere and loop over them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External links are now accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed unnecessary role properties from landmark regions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-maybe-things&#34;&gt;Future (maybe) things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert the journal section into a photos section, and then create a section for smaller posts. Similar to Colly&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;secondary &amp;#39;stream&amp;#39; (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://colly.com/stream&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    secondary &amp;#39;stream&amp;#39;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
 of posts. Having different post types is starting to make me feel like I&amp;rsquo;m building my own custom Tumblr page. I kinda miss Tumblr. I know it&amp;rsquo;s still there, but I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in using it anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all of my books to 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;Library Thing (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    Library Thing
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
 and pull in books with their API. Or just make a yaml file of my books and loop over that. I sort of want to stay clear of APIs in case they change something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisit adding some sort of gallery or favorite photos page. Or maybe a proper portfolio? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure just yet. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;, just a bunch of snapshits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities of a personal site are endless. You can do as much or as little as you want.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The sun was out, and if I don&amp;rsquo;t get enough of it I feel cranky. So during lunch breaks I go for a 30 minute/~3 mile run. Somehow I forgot that we had a massive storm yesterday that gave us 3+ inches of rain. Getting to the greenway was easy enough, but more often than not I had to walk due to the amount of mud and water covering the paved path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still enjoyed it, and was just happy to get outside in the sun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this evening we made it to the gym for the first time since December. Didn&amp;rsquo;t get a whole lot in, but we still went, and that&amp;rsquo;s matters. Our shed is still in the works, so the reality of a home gym is pretty far away.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware it was supposed to rain today. Let alone an entire storm that covered the whole east coast. Our iPhones blared flash flood warnings multiple times. A tornado apparently touched down right beside our neighborhood, right around the same time we were chasing down our trash bins before they were blown into a neighbors car. We made it through the entire day with no loss of power&amp;hellip;until right after work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, we had dinner with Ryan and Robbie at Phở Hương Que, a Vietnamese place I&amp;rsquo;d never been to. Phở was a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am now much farther into my January book; 
&lt;a aria-label=&#34;The Contortionists Handbook (opens in new window)&#34; href=&#34;https://www.librarything.com/work/11640&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;
    The Contortionists Handbook
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;svg aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; class=&#34;external-link-icon&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M 5 3 C 3.9069372 3 3 3.9069372 3 5 L 3 19 C 3 20.093063 3.9069372 21 5 21 L 19 21 C 20.093063 21 21 20.093063 21 19 L 21 12 L 19 12 L 19 19 L 5 19 L 5 5 L 12 5 L 12 3 L 5 3 z M 14 3 L 14 5 L 17.585938 5 L 8.2929688 14.292969 L 9.7070312 15.707031 L 19 6.4140625 L 19 10 L 21 10 L 21 3 L 14 3 z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
, which is very good so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power didn&amp;rsquo;t come back on until 3:00 AM. We know because when the power comes back on, the Hue bulbs in our nightstand lamps turn back on at full brightness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>White Throated Sparrow</title>

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lots of housework today. Finally putting some pictures in frames. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a setting anywhere to turn this off, so beware ordering prints from Shutterfly. They crop in about 5-10%. Combine that with mats from ready-made picture frames, and you lose a bit of your photo. Some need to be reprinted but most are fine as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually went for a walk in the park next to our neighborhood. I expected a lot more bird activity, but this little sparrow was about it. Thankfully it was sitting very close and didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care about us. Normally the smaller birds won&amp;rsquo;t sit still for you for more than three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rain. Just nonstop rain since before we even went to bed last night. We didn&amp;rsquo;t do a whole lot and I guess that&amp;rsquo;s OK. With both of us fighting a cold and Mitch&amp;rsquo;s back pain, why not just watch football and eat pizza?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This frittata was the only thing worth taking a photo of today. It was also very tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
