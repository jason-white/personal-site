        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Been dealing with a bit of a stomach bug and needed to get out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walked around some of the smaller trails within the park next to our neighborhood. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to photograph birds because there&amp;rsquo;s little light. You can push the camera, but it&amp;rsquo;s less than ideal. I was kind of joking with myself that I get better bird photographs just strolling around the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left with nothing I decided to head back. As I&amp;rsquo;m coming off the greenway entrance onto a cul de sac, I notice a deer. Then a few steps ahead I see a beautiful cardinal snacking at a bird feeder. And then, after walking up the street maybe 25 more yards, I just happened to look up and see this stunning red-shouldered hawk sitting on a light post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bucket list bird. It just sat there not minding me at all. Eventually it flew up into a tree a couple houses back. So I slowly approached from the other side of the street. Photographing it as I was walking closer and closer, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care. I could have stood there and photographed this bird all evening. I felt satisfied with what I got, trying not to chimp on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today I learned that if you go to the most-northern part of Topsail Island, you can drive on the beach! Apparently I&amp;rsquo;ve been there numerous times as a kid, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall. Every local beach looks the same when you&amp;rsquo;re five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to walk around and take some photos. The beach was a lot less crowded than I expected, so I paid more attention to the landscape rather than people. Really enjoyed these duplex beach houses. Fun colors! I shot a roll of Provia 100f as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to send those off to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a great time, and next time we will be better prepared with shade, more snacks and better seating.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Worked from the beach. Did not get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom came by after work with my aunt, cousin and her husband. It was great seeing my cousin. She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and all things considered, she&amp;rsquo;s in high spirits. Always the jokester. They brought us fried shrimp plates from Huffman&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard. So. Damn. Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent the afternoon walking around Surf City with Luke and Gregg. Had some ice cream, walked the pier and hit up Trailer Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished the night relaxing on the deck listening to the ocean across the waterway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Touristy Day in DC</title>

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We needed something to do while waiting for the M83 concert later, and our hotel was a walking distance to the National Mall and museums, so we hoofed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapped a few photos of touristy things, but also snapped photos of tourists doing touristy things. It started to drizzle so we decided to visit the Smithsonian Natural History museum, which I&amp;rsquo;d never actually stepped inside of before. We had intentions of going over to the art museum, but an unexpected downpour started. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t letting up so we waited in line at the gift shop and paid far too much for a cheap umbrella and some ponchos. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have much of a choice as the show was starting in a couple of hours and had to head back to the hotel beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Noticed this abandoned restaurant next to a gas station we stopped at on a drive up to DC. I&amp;rsquo;m only just now realizing the sign says &amp;ldquo;est. 1929.&amp;rdquo; I love the giant Helvetica &amp;ldquo;RESTAURANT&amp;rdquo; sign in front of the building, but I wish it stood out more in the photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I finally got to see 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://draplin.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Draplin&lt;/a&gt;
 speak. This has been on a list for quite some time. And if I weren&amp;rsquo;t heading to DC the next day I would have definitely taken his workshop. The event was made possible by AAF Charlotte and the One Club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first learned of Aaron Draplin through 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisglass.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chris Glass&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;
 site, maybe 20+ years ago? Probably from the Layer Tennis match between the two, and have been following his work ever since. I got to shake his hand as he was setting up his merch booth. We chatted briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk was fantastic. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched a few online before, but it was really cool to see some new things and just get an overall sense of what he&amp;rsquo;s been up to. He makes it all look so easy, but really he just works damn hard and is super good at what he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real life Never Not Working if there ever was one.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First time out birding and all I got was this duck&amp;rsquo;s ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about this in my offline journal, but to be fair, there was &lt;em&gt;a lot going on&lt;/em&gt;. Yesterday, my company announced a 15% layoff via email. I was not impacted. I will not go into details. Needless to say work has been &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. One thing that happened on this day is a package was delivered containing a Sony 200-600mm lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently sold my Nikon that I use for scanning and replaced it with a new-to-me Sony A7R IV. I chose this camera for a handful of reasons. One is to use it for scanning up to (eventually) 4x5 large format negatives, utilizing its pixel shift feature. Another was to finally take a crack at bird photography. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to try for a very long time, but never had the means to acquire the equipment. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to let a camera like that be used strictly for scanning negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of back and forth between the 200-600mm G and the 100-400mm G master lens. The latter may produce slightly sharper results, but I wanted the reach more than the (barely?) difference in quality or sharpness. So after a lot of YouTube videos and a good copy finally popping up used for a decent deal, I pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly? I absolutely love it. After getting certain settings down, of course. Which took a while and more YouTube videos. Modern cameras are&amp;hellip;a lot. One thing I&amp;rsquo;d like is a black pro mist filter for it, but the filter size is so huge that this particular filter in that size is a bit costly. Maybe one will pop up on KEH or eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optical image stabilization is good enough that I don&amp;rsquo;t need a tripod 💪, however, a monopod in the future may be a decent investment. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are some insane tripod/monopod + head combinations that make bird photography an absolute breeze compared to handheld shooting. Maybe someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, since work was basically on pause due to the chaos mentioned above, I took a break and headed to a nearby park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1689732915/2023%20Posts/03/2023-03-23_bird-photography/2023-03-23_A7Riv-28.jpg&#34;

      &lt;p&gt;200-600mm G / Sony A7R IV&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That poor turtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not terrible for a quick outing. There will be a lot more bird photos on the site, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun. It&amp;rsquo;s the most fun I&amp;rsquo;ve had doing photography in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Easy day. Some chores, some errands, some meal prep. But the day started with a trip to 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pepperbox.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pepperbox Doughnuts&lt;/a&gt;
, which we do not do often enough. We used to track them down when they were a small pop-up operation throughout Charlotte. They&amp;rsquo;ve since grown to two locations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Work has been full of self-evaluations all week. Not much else to think about there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work we had dinner with Ryan and Robbie at Ru-Sans. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been here in a while and I am happy to report that it has not changed at all. I had shoyu ramen and a &amp;ldquo;Dragon Eye&amp;rdquo; roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner a storm came through and knocked our power out for the night. I thought it would be a good time to test the Sony A7R in low light. Pretty good, honestly a bit more noisy than I expected for such a high-end sensor. Since I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post &lt;em&gt;so late&lt;/em&gt;, I have Lightroom&amp;rsquo;s new AI denoise available. And it. Is. Amazing. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly so so good. No loss of any detail. The image above was shot at ISO 6400. There&amp;rsquo;s a film preset I use that added a tiny bit of grain in (which Lightroom is kind of terrible at reproducing), but it&amp;rsquo;s almost a night and day difference. Here&amp;rsquo;s a 100% crop comparison before any other edits were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1689691457/2023%20Posts/03/2023-03-03_power-outage/lightroom-denoise.jpg&#34;

        &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513106/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-24.jpg" alt=a tote bag with a graphic that reads &#39;tantrum con&#39; sits on a table in a large hotel conference room full of people playing board games /&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
              
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TantrumCon is a board game convention by Tantrum House, a board game media group. There are 100s of games you can learn to play, tournaments, prizes and giveaways. There&amp;rsquo;s also some sort of table flipping event (tantrum) that I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand, but it was fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513106/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-8.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;a conference room is filled with a large group of people sitting at different tables playing board games&#34;loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
  /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people, so many games. There&amp;rsquo;s a library where you can check out games and learn to play. Most tables had a sign that you could display saying either &amp;ldquo;players wanted&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;teachers wanted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513107/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-7.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;a wall lined with wire shelving full of different board games&#34;loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
  /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first game I learned was 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265736/tiny-towns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tiny Towns&lt;/a&gt;
. A cute, quick-paced game where you build your town on a 4x4 grid and use resources in specific layouts to create buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513106/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-13.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;there&amp;#39;s a small game board on a table with different shaped game pieces on it. the table has other small game pieces scattered about&#34;loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
  /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty fun. The rules are simple enough and each round doesn&amp;rsquo;t take very long. A good group game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also the 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266524/parks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Parks&lt;/a&gt;
 game which is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;. Another great group game. You play the role of hikers and make your way through different national parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513107/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-28.jpg&#34;

  /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually took a break and met some friends at Protagonist. A brewery/pizza place. The pizza was very good. We ordered way too much food, as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513106/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-30.jpg&#34;

  /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next game I learned was later in the evening, called 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248490/atlantis-rising-second-edition&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Atlantis Rising&lt;/a&gt;
. We may have played this one wrong, but either way it&amp;rsquo;s very long and kinda complicated. The instructions seemed to be poorly written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513107/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-42.jpg&#34;

      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home, Mitch watched a fairly long YouTube video on how to play. I think we were at the table playing this until midnight. It was a few hours, for sure. Still fun, even if we played it a little incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived a little late. Mitch and Chase were playing 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/304051/creature-comforts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Creature Comforts&lt;/a&gt;
 while John, Powell and Raleigh were playing 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227935/wonderlands-war&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wonderland&amp;#39;s War&lt;/a&gt;
 (a highly anticipated game of the weekend from what I recall.) They were playing this for 3+ hours or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688696487/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-25_m10-p-6.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;a group of people sitting around a table are instructed on how to play Wonderland&amp;#39;s War, a board game based on Alice in Wonderland&#34;loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
  /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first game I played with everyone was 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/219215/werewords&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Werewords&lt;/a&gt;
, which was really fun, and definitely a great group game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of Werewords, we tried this game called 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/348096/kites&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kites&lt;/a&gt;
, where you have to play a card and then flip a sand timer, but you also have to make sure none of the timers run out. It goes extremely fast, and is very difficult to reach the end goal, even when there are six people working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had dinner with Raleigh, Ethan and Chase at Saigon Palace. Probably the most consistently good restaurant I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. I had stir-fried curry with vermicelli noodles. So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at Tantrum Con very much on day three. On the first day, everyone gets a raffle ticket when you pick up your pass and swag at the registration desk. They draw numbers throughout the whole event. I won a game called 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/377233/bulldonkey&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bulldonkey&lt;/a&gt;
, which we haven&amp;rsquo;t played yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513107/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-26_m10-p-8.jpg&#34;
     alt=&#34;a group of people sitting around a table playing a rectangular board game with small pieces laid out on a grid, each player has cards. a box on the table reads &amp;#39;cat in the box&amp;#39;&#34;loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did get to play 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324345/cat-box&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cat in the Box&lt;/a&gt;
 which was a lot of fun. I feel it&amp;rsquo;s better explained at the provided link. It has to do with Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513107/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-26_m10-p-9-Enhanced-NR.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our buddy Mike ended up having a layover in Charlotte long enough to have a quick dinner. The conference was held at a hotel near the airport which made things a bit easier. Really great to see him. It&amp;rsquo;s been about six years.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days in Haw River hanging out with Brian and Jeremie. Lounged around for a bit early in the day chatting and having some (very) good coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their daughter stopped by and invited us to a chili cookoff at the high school her boyfriend attends. It was good fun, and most of the chili recipes that we tried were delicious. We all voted for her boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s parents chili and in all honesty it was the best one. The secret ingredient really came through. They also had a great 90s grunge/Nirvana theme going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After stuffing ourselves with a bunch of chili we caught a couple performances. One was a musical number with some dancing and flag waving. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a photo of the percussion performance, but it was outstanding. Apparently they&amp;rsquo;ve never lost a competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688781010/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-19_chili-cookoff/2023-03-11_xx-800_02-17.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening we headed to Hillsborough for dinner at Antonia&amp;rsquo;s, with a quick stop to hang out for drinks at the Wooden Nickel. Antonia&amp;rsquo;s is one of the best Italian restaurants I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. We had so much food. Everything was so, so good. I like Deviled Eggs, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688781747/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-19_chili-cookoff/2023-02-19_griii-10.jpg&#34;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The light was nice this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent the day meal prepping and tidying the house before company arrived. Jeremie got in around 6:00 and then we were off to meet Robbie and Ryan at YUME, a swank Japanese restaurant in South End. It was packed and our reservation wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready, but well worth the wait. Everything was delicious. Unfortunately no photos worth sharing, I was too busy enjoying the company and food, that I forgot to snap any photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Sidelines after dinner to see some friends and play a few games of darts. A really great evening.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How did we end up with three boxes of kosher salt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a few things to get done today and did just a few of them. For some reason we braved Costco on a Saturday. I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running errands it was time for a nap before heading to R&amp;amp;R&amp;rsquo;s for Ryan&amp;rsquo;s birthday. His birthday was actually yesterday, but we&amp;rsquo;re celebrating with dinner tonight at 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.genods.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Geno D&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt;
 pizza. It was delicious. Seriously that crust was something else. There was also this 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manobellaartisanfoods.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt;
 booth in the market, and I could not help myself. I bought some pasta for later, but of course I had to taste it while it was fresh. So good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1675023070/2023%20Posts/01/2023_01-28_ryan-birthday/2023-01-28_griii-7.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went back to R&amp;amp;R&amp;rsquo;s to watch M3GAN. What an entertaining horror comedy like no other. Made Child&amp;rsquo;s Play look like, well, child&amp;rsquo;s play. Chucky take a back seat. Also, the guy that does 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMdx5OxtAM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;your rich southern aunt&lt;/a&gt;
 videos is in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came home and finished backing up photos. Noticed that Lightroom didn&amp;rsquo;t move everything it said it did. Glad I made multiple backups and held off on deleting the files Lightroom sees. Didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to be doing that until 1:00am, but glad it&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cabin Trip</title>

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whew. I have been wanting to make this post (and many others) for quite a while. One thing holding me back is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to come up with a way to view a gallery of images per post. This post is dated for back in January, but a few days ago from the current time (June 18th (I know, I know.)), I some how came up with the idea to list out the data for the images in the YAML frontmatter of the post&amp;rsquo;s markdown file. You see, I use Hugo, a static site generator, to build my site. This means no back-end and that usually means no content management system. There are ways to setup a CMS for static sites, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never explored them. So everything is in markdown files. I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post later on what I did exactly, but for now I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention it involves looping over YAML data with the Golang template, and then &lt;del&gt;using VueJS to create a little lightbox component per image&lt;/del&gt;. I switched over to 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://photoswipe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PhotoSwipe&lt;/a&gt;
. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a few other people using it, after examining how flexible it is, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d rather spend my time adding to the site instead of maintaining and updating my own image lightbox. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to setup, easy to customize, accessible and mobile friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we spent a long weekend in a large cabin over in Tennessee with a bunch of friends from Raleigh. Right outside the Smokys. The drive up wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. We originally planned on switching halfway, but I was having so much fun driving the new truck in the mountains I just kept going. Even through the snow, which I have zero experience driving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the trip was a lot of fun. Lots of games, really good food and a heck of a dance party. They went all out. There was even a disco ball strung up over the great room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good,h_1365,w_2048/v1687125291/2023%20Posts/01/2023-01-13_cabin-trip-january/2023-01-14_m10p-2.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last day of the trip we went down to Gatlinburg. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been downtown since I was a kid. We went to this activity games place where there is a large assortment of active games and escape rooms. The games were very fun, and very much a form of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good,h_1365,w_2048/v1687125328/2023%20Posts/01/2023-01-13_cabin-trip-january/2023-01-17_leica-m10p-36.jpg&#34;

      &lt;p&gt;50mm Summilux ASPH / Leica M10-P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive home was nice. Google Maps routed us to go through the Foothills Parkway, which had a few nice overlooks. It was incredibly foggy. The Smoky Mountains definitely showed off the &amp;ldquo;smoke.&amp;rdquo; So much dense fog everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more photos from the trip:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Woke up, made coffee. Realized the World Cup started 15 minutes ago. Argentina really controlled the first half, but France certainly retaliated quickly. What an incredible World Cup final. Greatest ever, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started making Christmas cookies for gifts. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this several &lt;del&gt;weeks&lt;/del&gt; months later, and I can tell you, that we barely gave any away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through, a neighbor is knocking on our door. Neighbors never knock on our door. Turns out we have a busted water pipe that&amp;rsquo;s been leaking for at least two days. Fantastic! All the rain we&amp;rsquo;ve had masked it. It was when the rain finally stopped that a neighbor noticed a trail of water flowing down to his yard. That was a fun, unexpected expense. 🙃&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Braved Costco on a Sunday. The house is severely lacking in Christmas decorations. We found a small tree to put beside the front door (not pictured.) We also got a new faucet for the kitchen sink (also not pictured, but here is Mitch installing it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I made some chili with stew beef, which I&amp;rsquo;ve not used for chili before. It was really good, so this may be what I stick with. The key if not slow or pressure cooking is to cut the chunks of beef smaller, then sear the beef in small batches not to over-crowd the pan. The best recipes are almost always more time-consuming. It&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent the rest of the night scanning photos, watching Argentina vs Mexico and then the Packers vs the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Headed to Huffman Vineyard&amp;rsquo;s to see the family for Aunt Rita&amp;rsquo;s birthday. I love coming here. The owner has a food truck now and churns out some of the best southern-style seafood I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. She is such a talented woman. I need to take more photos around the property sometime. I had a BBQ sandwich and some fried oysters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle Henry arrived. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see him. He&amp;rsquo;s my dad&amp;rsquo;s uncle and almost 90. And very lively for 90, too. Had to help him figure out his Android device, which I&amp;rsquo;ll admit stumped me and I had to ask someone that owned an Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got ready to head back home and snapped a pic of uncle Henry and my dad. It was the last shot on the roll and I&amp;rsquo;m very thankful it turned out. I want to darkroom print this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headed off for the four hour drive home. Mitch was cooking mashed potatoes to bring as a side to Matt and Allen&amp;rsquo;s Friendsgiving party. He also made banana bread. Everything there was very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went home and played my copy of Dream Unending&amp;rsquo;s 

  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.discogs.com/master/2844619-Dream-Unending-Song-Of-Salvation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Song of Salvation&lt;/a&gt;
 that came in. I love this band. Some of the best, most unique doom metal I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in so long.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t take many photos this Thanksgiving. But, I did eat a lot. Like, way too much. And then watched football all day and night. That was it.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1680052674/2022%20Posts/2022-11-19_jasons-housewarming-friendsgiving/2022-11-27_xx-01-8-positive.jpg" alt=Man watching the television. The headline reads &#39;Girl hit by pickup truck&#39; during the Raleigh Christmas Parade /&gt;
          &lt;figcaption&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Woke up a little late. Missed the Jordan 1 Chicago draw because the SNKRS app kept failing. Got ready to head to brunch at this place called Craft. Before we left, Greg had the news on. A little girl was hit by a pickup truck in the Raleigh Christmas parade. She was taken to the hospital but not sure what the outcome was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Craft and ran into Tim, Darious, Chase, Ethan and Jay. They recommended the breakfast pizza as an appetizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakfast pizza had sausage gravy as a &amp;ldquo;sauce&amp;rdquo; and was topped with eggs, cheese, pepporoni and Italian sausage. Damn. As good as that was, my French toast was even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headed over to Black and White coffee, because I can&amp;rsquo;t visit Raleigh and not buy too much coffee here. Also, Luke met some dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1680052386/2022%20Posts/2022-11-19_jasons-housewarming-friendsgiving/2022-11-27_xx-01-12.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we headed to Jason&amp;rsquo;s. A lot of people had already shown up. Lots of friends we hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in years. The food was fantastic. I ate too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1680053001/2022%20Posts/2022-11-19_jasons-housewarming-friendsgiving/2022-11-27_xx-01-26.jpg&#34;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of us went in on a Solo Stove fire pit as a house warming gift. We used it all night and I can definitely recommend them.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mostly a lazy day. Ran some errands. Got an optical cable for the new TV. It works well in case we need to use the antenna or PS5. Figured out my costume, which is Daniel Arnold. Pretty easy. Just bring my camera and dress how I normally do. I wore overalls which seem to be a hit every time. Need to get more I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustin absolutely killed it with his Orville Peck costume.&lt;/p&gt;
