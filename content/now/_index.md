September 28, 2023

Thought I'd give the {{< link href="https://nownownow.com/about" text="Now" >}} page a go, an idea I got from the wonderful {{< link href="https://chrisglass.com/" text="Chris Glass" >}}.

I like this photo of my parents and I from earlier this month. I'm trying to use the 4x5 more. I'll probably switch it out when I develop the sheet of the three of us with Mitch.

Fall weather is settling in. Something always welcome when you live in the South. I was able to run a 5k today fairly easy.

Excited for a few things coming up. Atlanta Pride in October, seeing HÃ¤llas and going camping in November with a few friends.

We're starting a fairly large home project. Building a shed with a deck around it, and the goal is to have a home gym with storage above.

Planning for a trip to Berlin next year.

Watched Bottoms last night. So random. So many unanswered questions. I loved it.

Still reading Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow because, well, because I can't focus on anything anymore apparently.

Some albums currently on repeat:
- Nolan Potter's Nightmare Band - Nightmare Forever
- Nolan Potter's Nightmare Band - Music Is Dead
- Impending Joy
- Blood Incantation - Luminescent Bridge
- Tombmold - The Enduring Spirit
