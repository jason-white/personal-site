ðŸš§ This site is currently under construction ðŸš§

My name is Jason and this is my little slice of the internet. As the 90s-inspired construction emoji that frames the message above indicates, this site is still being worked on. At some point I will remove the message, but the site will continue to be developed "live" so-to-speak.

There isn't a lot of content at the moment, but feel free to browse the [journal](/journal/) or recent finds around the internet via <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:jasonwhite" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>. For more information about me and the website, please see the [about](/about/) page.
