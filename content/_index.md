---

My name is Jason and this is my little slice of the internet. It's ever-changing and being developed "live" so-to-speak. Little bits and features are added here and there.

Most of the content is within the [journal](/journal/) or recent finds around the internet via <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:jasonwhite" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>. For more information about me and the website, please see the [about](/about/) page.

Here's a little todo list to keep me reminded ✏️

- Create proper Archives page for posts
- Revamp the About page and kinda merge it with the Uses page
- Create a portfolio page
- Thinking of squeezing VueJS in just to make a gallery shortcode for Hugo
- I'd like to create a space for yearly Spotify playlists of new-to-me songs I found for that year
