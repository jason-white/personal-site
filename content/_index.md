This site is currently 🚧 under construction 🚧

Working on the layout and then will begin updating the journal with photos.

I should probably take some photos. 🤔

### Todo:

- Figure out some sort of bookmark/found links/favorites archive to pull in
- Display list of posts on homepage _OR_..._blogroll?!_ 😬
- Recent book reads? Favorite podcasts?
- Create a "uses" page
- Possibly backdate some posts to add 'old' content
- Make everything accessible
- Make responsive
