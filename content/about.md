Hello, I'm Jason. I live in Charlotte with my husband and work as a web developer with a focus on user experience and accessibility. Sometimes I like to pretend I'm a designer, and in my free time I enjoy photography.

This website is built using Hugo, a static site generator. I took a step back late 2023/early 2024 and decided that I needed to dig in and fix some things, reorganize others and start to make room for various types of content. So it's in a bit of a "under construction" state at the moment, and that's ok. It will probably be like this forever.
