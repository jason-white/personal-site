### Hi there

My name is Jason. Professionally I'm a web designer and developer, but outside of work I really enjoy photographing things. I live in Charlotte, North Carolina with my husband. Dog is pending.

This year (2020) I've decided I wanted to be a little more hands-on. I enjoyed the days when everyone had a website and shared little snippets of their personal life or hobbies. Before services and web applications became the norm. 

So that's what this website is, really. Getting back to doing a lot of the things I used to enjoy and documenting them. Sure, there are many other ways of documenting every day life. Some are quite simple, or _convenient_. But there's something very satisfying about going through the whole process. Besides, this is personal. There's no rush.

Eventually I'll create a post going over the ins-and-outs of the website, how it was created, what software and services I'm using etc. But for now I'll just say, its current and future state is heavily influenced by <a href="https://chrisglass.com/" target="_blank">Chris Glass</a> and <a href="https://frankchimero.com" target="_blank">Frank Chimero</a>.

✌️
