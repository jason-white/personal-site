Hello, I’m Jason. I live in Charlotte, North Carolina, with my husband and work as a web developer specializing in user experience and accessibility. Sometimes, I pretend I’m a designer.

In my free time, I enjoy photography—mostly documenting my life, along with friends and family, though I occasionally go out birding.

I also enjoy coffee.

## This Website

My site is built using Hugo, a {{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator" text="static site generator" >}} (or SSG for short), and I absolutely love it. The more I work on the site, the more I learn about Hugo and all it can do.

Images are hosted via {{< link href="https://cloudinary.com/" text="Cloudinary" >}}, a CDN for media. Using custom partials and shortcodes with Hugo, generating responsive images is a breeze—thanks to an incredibly helpful {{< link href="https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2023/07/hugo-pipes-cloudinary/" text="blog post" >}} by Bryce Wray.

I love static websites and have always sort of been in that "Anti-JavaScript JavaScript Club." I understand we sometimes need JavaScript, but I've never understood why people throw entire frameworks at something as simple as a blog. Also, CSS is pretty badass now. My goal with this site is to create a perfectly performant and accessible website with baseline features and progressive enhancement where it makes sense—all with little to no JS.
