What a gorgeous hi-fi system. It looks to have some inspiration from the {{< link href="https://braunaudio.de/en/braun-hifi-wall-unit-wandanlage-stereo-system-60ties/" text="Vitsoe/Braun wall unit" >}} designed by Dieter Rams, but much more brutalist? I love the overall look and feel. Kind of cold vs the warm sound you'd get from vinyl records. The cables running from component to component reminds me of a eurorack synthesizer setup.
