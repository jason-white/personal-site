I haven't listened to TOKiMONSTA in a while. I really like her music. She's a beat producer, or at least started out as one. {{< link href="https://album.link/s/7xDQlillR9FwIIoxgKSEQb" text="Her new album" >}} is more house and disco, and so far, I am really digging it.

Her picks on this episode of What's In My Bag were all super good, but what I'm mostly interested in is this set of books by {{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Nagai" text="Hiroshi Nagai." >}} His illustrations look like vectors, but they're all hand painted. He apparently did a lot of {{< link href="https://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/japanese-city-pop-ultimate-guide" text="Japanese City Pop" >}} album covers.
