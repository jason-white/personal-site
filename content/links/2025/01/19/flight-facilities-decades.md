Flight Facilities, a DJ/production duo from Australia, released four mixes back in 2013. Each one spanning a decade, starting with 1972, and ending at 2012. The mixes take you on a little music journey through each decade, incorporating pop music and major news headlines on a timeline.

I used to jog around our old neighborhood listening to the 1982-1992 mix all the time.

I'm not sure what prompted me to look these up again, as I've had them saved for a while, but I was very excited to see that they've added two more decades! 1962-1972 and 2012-2022. They fit in perfectly with the original four. Still super fun and really well done.

Related: another amazing era mix is {{< link href="https://archive.org/details/djspinbad90smegamix" text="DJ Spinbad's 90's Megamix." >}} Quite possibly one of the best, and most fun mixes I've ever heard.
