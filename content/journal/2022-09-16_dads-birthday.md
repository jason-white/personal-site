We made a quick trip to the coast to see my parents for my dad's birthday. His birthday is technically next week but we have a trip that was already planned in advanced.

Day one was pretty low-key. We mostly just sat around and talked. There was a nice, as always, sunset over the bay. Dad enjoyed his gifts which were all steel guitar related. He started playing again but currently his guitars are in the shop getting tuned.
