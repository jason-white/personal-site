TantrumCon is a board game convention by Tantrum House, a board game media group. There are 100s of games you can learn to play, tournaments, prizes and giveaways. There's also some sort of table flipping event (tantrum) that I don't quite understand, but it was fun to watch.

### Day 1

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpmsynxig/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:good/v1688513106/2023%20Posts/02/2023-02-24_tantrum-con-2023/2023-02-24_m10-p-8.jpg" alt="a conference room is filled with a large group of people sitting at different tables playing board games" caption="28mm Elmarit ASPH / Leica M10-P" >}}

So many people, so many games. There's a library where you can check out games and learn to play. Most tables had a sign that you could display saying either "players wanted" or "teachers wanted."

The first game I learned was {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265736/tiny-towns" text="Tiny Towns" >}}. A cute, quick-paced game where you build your town on a 4x4 grid and use resources in specific layouts to create buildings.

It's pretty fun. The rules are simple enough and each round doesn't take very long. A good group game.

There was also the {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266524/parks" text="Parks" >}} game which is _beautiful_. Another great group game. You play the role of hikers and make your way through different national parks.

We eventually took a break and met some friends at Protagonist. A brewery/pizza place. The pizza was very good. We ordered way too much food, as usual.

The next game I learned was later in the evening, called {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248490/atlantis-rising-second-edition" text="Atlantis Rising" >}}. We may have played this one wrong, but either way it's very long and kinda complicated. The instructions seemed to be poorly written.

On the way home, Mitch watched a fairly long YouTube video on how to play. I think we were at the table playing this until midnight. It was a few hours, for sure. Still fun, even if we played it a little incorrectly.

### Day 2

I arrived a little late. Mitch and Chase were playing {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/304051/creature-comforts" text="Creature Comforts" >}} while John, Powell and Raleigh were playing {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/227935/wonderlands-war" text="Wonderland's War" >}} (a highly anticipated game of the weekend from what I recall.) They were playing this for 3+ hours or so.

The first game I played with everyone was {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/219215/werewords" text="Werewords" >}}, which was really fun, and definitely a great group game.

After a few rounds of Werewords, we tried this game called {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/348096/kites" text="Kites" >}}, where you have to play a card and then flip a sand timer, but you also have to make sure none of the timers run out. It goes extremely fast, and is very difficult to reach the end goal, even when there are six people working together.

We had dinner with Raleigh, Ethan and Chase at Saigon Palace. Probably the most consistently good restaurant I've ever been to. I had stir-fried curry with vermicelli noodles. So good.

### Day 3

I wasn't at Tantrum Con very much on day three. On the first day, everyone gets a raffle ticket when you pick up your pass and swag at the registration desk. They draw numbers throughout the whole event. I won a game called {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/377233/bulldonkey" text="Bulldonkey" >}}, which we haven't played yet.

I did get to play {{< link href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324345/cat-box" text="Cat in the Box" >}} which was a lot of fun. I feel it's better explained at the provided link. It has to do with Schr√∂dinger's cat.

Our buddy Mike ended up having a layover in Charlotte long enough to have a quick dinner. The conference was held at a hotel near the airport which made things a bit easier. Really great to see him. It's been about six years.
