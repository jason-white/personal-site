How did we end up with three boxes of kosher salt?

Had a few things to get done today and did just a few of them. For some reason we braved Costco on a Saturday. I don't recommend it.

After running errands it was time for a nap before heading to R&R's for Ryan's birthday. His birthday was actually yesterday, but we're celebrating with dinner tonight at {{< link href="https://www.genods.com/" text="Geno D's" >}} pizza. It was delicious. Seriously that crust was something else. There was also this {{< link href="https://www.manobellaartisanfoods.com/" text="pasta" >}} booth in the market, and I could not help myself. I bought some pasta for later, but of course I had to taste it while it was fresh. So good.

After dinner we went back to R&R's to watch M3GAN. What an entertaining horror comedy like no other. Made Child's Play look like, well, child's play. Chucky take a back seat. Also, the guy that does {{< link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMdx5OxtAM" text="your rich southern aunt" >}} videos is in it.

Came home and finished backing up photos. Noticed that Lightroom didn't move everything it said it did. Glad I made multiple backups and held off on deleting the files Lightroom sees. Didn't expect to be doing that until 1:00am, but glad it's done.
