We needed something to do while waiting for the M83 concert later, and our hotel was a walking distance to the National Mall and museums, so we hoofed it. 

Snapped a few photos of touristy things, but also snapped photos of tourists doing touristy things. It started to drizzle so we decided to visit the Smithsonian Natural History museum, which I'd never actually stepped inside of before. We had intentions of going over to the art museum, but an unexpected downpour started. It wasn't letting up so we waited in line at the gift shop and paid far too much for a cheap umbrella and some ponchos. We didn't have much of a choice as the show was starting in a couple of hours and had to head back to the hotel beforehand.
