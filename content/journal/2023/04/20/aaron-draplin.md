I finally got to see {{< link href="https://draplin.com" text="Draplin" >}} speak. This has been on a list for quite some time. And if I weren't heading to DC the next day I would have definitely taken his workshop. The event was made possible by AAF Charlotte and the One Club.

I first learned of Aaron Draplin through {{< link href="https://chrisglass.com/" text="Chris Glass'" >}} site, maybe 20+ years ago? Probably from the Layer Tennis match between the two, and have been following his work ever since. I got to shake his hand as he was setting up his merch booth. We chatted briefly.

The talk was fantastic. I've watched a few online before, but it was really cool to see some new things and just get an overall sense of what he's been up to. He makes it all look so easy, but really he just works damn hard and is super good at what he does.

A real life Never Not Working if there ever was one.
