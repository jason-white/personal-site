We've known Brian and Jeremie for many years, but have really gotten to know them in 2023. We drove up Saturday to hang out and help them pack the rest of their belongings. Had a great dinner at Burlington Beer Works. Get the brussels sprouts. And the spinach artichoke dip. And the cauliflower bites.

Sunday we helped them pack up the U-Haul and then met everyone at Ponysaurus in Durham for the going away party. Lots of faces we haven't seen in a while. It's always great to catch up. I had a kombucha and they put it in a fancy glass. I felt like an adult. I took a handful of photos, both film and digital. I didn't realize it, but I had an old bulk roll of HP5 in the M-A that I used an inferior tape on and it popped off at the end of the roll. I was able to save it, I just haven't developed it yet.

It's bittersweet and they will be dearly missed, but I wish them all the best in Kentucky. We will be visiting as often as we can.
