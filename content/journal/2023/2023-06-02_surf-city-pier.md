Worked from the beach. Did not get a lot done. 

Mom came by after work with my aunt, cousin and her husband. It was great seeing my cousin. She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and all things considered, she's in high spirits. Always the jokester. They brought us fried shrimp plates from Huffman's Vineyard. So. Damn. Good.

Spent the afternoon walking around Surf City with Luke and Gregg. Had some ice cream, walked the pier and hit up Trailer Bar.

Finished the night relaxing on the deck listening to the ocean across the waterway.
