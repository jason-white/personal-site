I can't remember exactly how I heard of Impending Joy, but it wasn't very long ago, and I was hooked immediately. A surf/psych-rock band that gets surprisingly heavy at times. Hailing from Asheville, NC, they currently have one single titled _Dry Pond_ (unless you count the demos on Bandcamp) and I can't stop listening to it. 

I purposely haven't listened to the demos because I'm eagerly awaiting the full album release. I'm told the second single should be about in a couple of weeks with the album following in a month or so. Here's their {{< link href="https://impendingjoy.bandcamp.com/track/dry-pond" text="Bandcamp" >}} if you'd like to check them out.

The live show blew me away. As I mentioned before, they get _surprisingly_ heavy. It was a little difficult to photograph because I only knew one song, but I had a great time.

The opener, _Top Achiever_ was fun. A lo-fi electronic, reverberated vocal, kinda dream-pop solo act. He seemed a bit nervous at first, but I think he performed well enough.

We didn't stick around for the headliner, Nolan Potter's Nightmare band. I've never regretted skipping a show more in my life. The album _Nightmare Forever_ is phenomenal. It's poppy, it's progressive, it's pyschedelic. Honestly have no idea how I've never heard it until now. Here's the {{< link href="https://nolanpotter.bandcamp.com/album/nightmare-forever" text="Bandcamp" >}} page if you'd like to listen. My co-workers in Austin are going to ream me for missing this one. ðŸ˜…

While waiting for bands to start before and between sets I made a {{< link href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3uAiL9EyyCSeg2SWcxL8F8?si=cff48fd8ed6a47a1" text="Spotify playlist">}} of all the music the venue played over the PA. It's all funk and soul. Going to try and start doing this at every show if I can.

Here are a few more photos from the show.
