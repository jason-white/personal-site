I really like the idea of Dave Rupert's Vibe Check posts, so I decided to do something similar. "Similar", as in the exact same thing. I'm using the idea.

I fully intended (months ago) to make daily posts, but the photos weren't keeping up with my offline journal. I write about the previous day every morning, but there isn't always an image to go with that. Factor in sometimes shooting film and it becomes a game of waiting for rolls to be finished, developed and scanned. Then a backlog of posts builds up, so that isn't working at the moment.

I still have a backlog of posts to go through, even if they aren't daily posts. My life is still being documented, which is what matters most. 

There's also always the constant flow of ideas for overall site updates, design changes, reorganization etc. But I've noticed lately that my time-management skills are downright awful after work
