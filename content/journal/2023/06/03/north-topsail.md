Today I learned that if you go to the most-northern part of Topsail Island, you can drive on the beach! Apparently I've been there numerous times as a kid, but I don't recall. Every local beach looks the same when you're five.

Had to walk around and take some photos. The beach was a lot less crowded than I expected, so I paid more attention to the landscape rather than people. Really enjoyed these duplex beach houses. Fun colors! I shot a roll of Provia 100f as well, but I've yet to send those off to be developed.

I had a great time, and next time we will be better prepared with shade, more snacks and better seating.
