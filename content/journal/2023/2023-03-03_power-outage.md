Work has been full of self-evaluations all week. Not much else to think about there.

After work we had dinner with Ryan and Robbie at Ru-Sans. We haven't been here in a while and I am happy to report that it has not changed at all. I had shoyu ramen and a "Dragon Eye" roll. 

After dinner a storm came through and knocked our power out for the night. I thought it would be a good time to test the Sony A7R in low light. Pretty good, honestly a bit more noisy than I expected for such a high-end sensor. Since I'm writing this post _so late_, I have Lightroom's new AI denoise available. And it. Is. Amazing. It's incredibly so so good. No loss of any detail. The image above was shot at ISO 6400. There's a film preset I use that added a tiny bit of grain in (which Lightroom is kind of terrible at reproducing), but it's almost a night and day difference. Here's a 100% crop comparison before any other edits were made.
