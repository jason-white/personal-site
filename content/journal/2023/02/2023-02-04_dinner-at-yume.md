The light was nice this morning.

Spent the day meal prepping and tidying the house before company arrived. Jeremie got in around 6:00 and then we were off to meet Robbie and Ryan at YUME, a swank Japanese restaurant in South End. It was packed and our reservation wasn't quite ready, but well worth the wait. Everything was delicious. Unfortunately no photos worth sharing, I was too busy enjoying the company and food, that I forgot to snap any photos.

We went to Sidelines after dinner to see some friends and play a few games of darts. A really great evening.
