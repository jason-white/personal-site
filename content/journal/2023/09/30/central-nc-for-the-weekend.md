Easy drive to Haw River after work for weekend hangs with Brian and Jeremie before they move in a few weeks. Snacked and chatted all night. 

The next morning Jeremie had volunteered to help with a friends Stonewall softball team, so Brian, Mitch and I headed to Press for brunch. There was a wait as expected, so we strolled around Graham for a little bit. I had the South by Southwest Crepe. Highly recommended. You will think you need to add something like potatoes. You don't. It's huge. The potatoes were good, though.

While waiting for Jeremie to get back, I decided to head up to the entrance of their neighborhood where this massive old barn sits. I've been wanting to photograph it for a while, and since I brought the 4x5 with me for portraits, I decided I'd expose a couple of sheets of the barn, too. I'm still very new to 4x5. I don't know how to properly use all of the movements, but it was fun to practice. Then I walked around and took some digital photos as well. Mental note: walk around your subject _first_. What you want to photography on the big expensive film may change. I regret not taking this photo on 4x5 with a slightly large aperture:

Live and learn.

Later we made some 4x5 portraits that came out mostly OK. No loading errors with these. Some slight development issues that aren't terrible. I'd probably have to point them out for anyone else to notice. Still learnin'.

Headed to Greensboro for dinner at Natty Greene's. Mitch and I haven't been here in ages. We used to live in Greensboro when I was going to UNCG. We miss the area and it isn't completely out of the cards to move back.
