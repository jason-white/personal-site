Disclaimer: this is not a how-to on installing insulation. I don't think I'm the right person for that. However, it was a lot easier than I expected. That's probably because we have a very roomy crawl space.

We've always noticed in the winter that our downstairs bathroom is really cold. Some parts of the floor were reading a 5-10 degree difference in some areas. After examining the insulation, or lack of it, we did a little research on how to best tackle the issue. We decided if we're going to do it ourselves, that {{< link href="https://www.rockwool.com/north-america/" text="rockwool" >}} was the way to go.

Fast-forward a year and we finally addressed it. Working with rockwool is very easy. Like, way easier than I imagined. I'm confident I could insulate our whole shed with this stuff by myself.

Just make sure you get all the right supplies. A respirator mask, goggles (mostly for removing old insulation) and a serrated knife. The stuff cuts easier than bread.

When we were done I figured why not take some photos of our dirty selves with the 4x5 since I already had some film loaded in the holders. I wanted to try this expired Kodak 320TXP really badly, and it had just been sitting since loaded in December.

These photos don't really give that whole 4x5 "look" as we were kinda close to the background, and I shot at f/22, mostly because that's where the light was, and I also never have enough light to reliably shoot at f/22. So I wanted to see how it would look. Still consider myself very new to the whole large format thing.

I framed Mitch, and then stood in his place, without refocusing, so shooting at a small aperture helped with the depth of field in case I didn't quite stand in the right spot.

Really happy with how the Tri-X turned out. I jacked the contrast up on the HP5 quite a bit and it still doesn't look as good as the Kodak. The photo of me on Tri-X had a nasty light leak. But at least I now know which film holder is the culprit!
