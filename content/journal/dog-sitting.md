Got to watch Farley and Memphis for the day while Robbie and Ryan had some house work being done. They're about as low-maintenance as it gets.

We've talked about getting a dog for a while now. The idea needs to stay on hold for a bit longer until we get some house things finished. Although, with all the work from home days lately, this might be the best time to raise a puppy.
