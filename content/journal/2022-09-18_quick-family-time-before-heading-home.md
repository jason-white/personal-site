We had to head back home from the coast fairly early, but hung out with some family on my uncles dock while Bill net-fished, Chandler brought his boat in that was having some engine trouble. While my dad, uncle and Chandler were troubleshooting the boat problems I snapped a few photos.

The drive home was OK, it's just really boring. NC is very flat until you make it all the way to the Western side of the state, leaving for little to no scenery.
