I used to play Magic: the Gathering all the time. _All_ the time. Fun fact: it's how Mitch and I met. The conversation starter was about a particular tattoo he has, and when I discovered it was related to Magic: the Gathering, a long conversation started and 13 years later here we are. ðŸ¥°

This was a lot of fun and we certainly need to do it again. We also need a larger table; I'm working on that. I'd never played {{< link href="https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/rules/" text="Commander" >}} before, which was created some time when I wasn't playing anymore.

I've been hesitant to get back into the game because it means buying stuff, stuff that takes up a lot of space, stuff that you have to _continue_ to buy if you want to keep up. But is that really so bad if you're having fun?

I played one of Adam's decks and I gotta make one of my own. The only Commander deck that I have is a pre-constructed one and it was kind of clunky in performance. Very slow to take off.
