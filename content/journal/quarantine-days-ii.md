Learned from friends today that the stay at home order in North Carolina is being extended until May 8th. Reopening will happen in three phases with the possibility to go backwards. The curve is "flattening" around Charlotte according to data a kind redditor keeps posting in /r/charlotte.

The weather has been mostly beautiful so it's hard not to go for walks after work. There are many trails in our neighboring park to keep it fresh. The greenway can be a bit busy but everyone is moving along at a decent pace.

All park equipment has been tied up or blocked off to keep people from gathering around. This probably drives a lot of people crazy but I'm pretty proud of the city overall.
