Woke up. Thought I'd sleep in more. Made a small breakfast. Made some very good coffee. We had lunch at Firebirds, which is still good, but I don't remember the pasta dish being $20. 

Finally got to see Everything Everywhere All at Once in the theater. It was released again just for this weekend I believe? _{{< link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTQvnhNVgxQ" text="Amazing." >}}_

I can't begin to think of how they pulled this off. It was very very good. Every minute was full of...something.
