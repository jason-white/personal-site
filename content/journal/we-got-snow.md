We _never_ get snow here. It's always ice and slush. I don't mind snow as long as it says goodbye pretty soon after it shows up. In the south we aren't nearly as prepared as they are up north. If it does actually snow or ice for a lengthy period of time, everything just shuts down. Also, flash photos in the snow are super fun.
