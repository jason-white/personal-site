Scanning film, at least for me, has been the most ever-changing part of my workflow. Getting film developed and scanned by a lab adds up _quick_, so it didn't take long for me to start researching my options. Like most, I originally went with a flatbed film scanner. I went with an Epson Perfection V600 due to the entry-level cost and I'd seen pretty good results around the web.

The V600 isn't a terrible scanner, but I wasn't very satisfied with it. I was getting OK results, and could probably push it a bit further with some better film holders, but it didn't seem worth the investment. The film holders can be expensive, tedious and overall a flatbed scanner is just very slow. You have to set your strips of film, try to get them as flat as possible, do a quick pass, get your image settings right, scan. Then repeat all of that for each set of strips (maybe two at a time.) This can make scanning a single roll of film take 30 minutes to an hour.

That's...less than ideal.

When I first got into shooting film again, a friend mentioned that people are now scanning their film with a dSLR or mirrorless camera with a macro lens. At the time I didn't think much of it, but after doing more research it was either start scanning with a camera, or shell out who knows how much for a Pakon or better.

At the time, I wasn't interested in spending a lot of money (over ~$1000 or so) for a dedicated film scanner. Also, most of them require old software that can only run on something like Windows XP and it all just seemed like a lot of trouble for the money.
