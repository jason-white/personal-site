This was a lovely day. We got quite a bit done. Cleaned the house, mowed the lawn, and went grocery shopping. Starting to get photos backed up but it is a painfully slow (and terrifying) process within Lightroom. The easiest way to maintain the Lightroom catalog while transferring images to the UnRAID server is to do it within Lightroom itself. Do _you_ trust Adobe to move your files across a network?

Later we headed to VTGCLT ({{< link href="http://vintage-charlotte.com/" text="Vintage Charlotte" >}}) to check out some goods and say hi to Ari. Ari owns {{< link href="https://www.twoshipspottery.com/" text="Two Ships Pottery" >}} and taught our pottery date class at the {{< link href="https://www.thelittlestudioclt.com/" text="Little Studio." >}} Fantastic guy and very talented artist! We commissioned him to make a piece that we gifted to friends for a housewarming. It isn't quite done at this point, but since I'm going back and making these posts I can talk about it. 

Here are some photos from walking around Camp Northend where VTGCLT was held.

Also, I _finally_ caught a {{< link href="https://www.charlottefootballclub.com/" text="Charlotte Football Club" >}} game! We lost ðŸ™ƒ.
