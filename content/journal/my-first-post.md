Going to leave this first post here for right now. The goal today was to get a Hugo site up and running on Netlify and I've done that with very little effort. ðŸ’ª As everyone else has been saying, Netlify was an absolute dream to use. I don't think it can get any more simplified.

So here's the To Do over the next week:

* Style this sucker!
* Write an actual blog post

Not too bad, I guess. Can probably handle that.
