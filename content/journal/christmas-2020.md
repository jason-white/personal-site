It's safe to say that 2020 has been a shit year for most, if not everyone. The timeline a seemingly never-ending rollercoaster of ups and downs, and downs...and downs. So not really a rollercoaster at all. More like one of those rides that just drop you.

The photo above was taken during a CLT Shooters photo walk in mid-town. These are fun, laid back photo walks with local photographers. Models come along as well for people to practice portraits. Great opportunity to meet other photographers and get some practice in. I was mostly testing out the 150mm lens for the Hasselblad 500c that day.

Still no good way of scanning 120 until after the holidays, so I did a quick and dirty of this by taping the negative to the light. It kinda worked.
