As we were leaving our neighborhood to run errands yesterday I noticed this beautiful 351 Boss Mustang parked on the street. I'd never seen it before and hoped it would still be there when were got back home. Thankfully it was and so I grabbed a camera and went for a short stroll to snap some pics. I know it was only walking around the corner to take some photos of an old car, but it felt nice. I haven't intentionally gone out to take any photographs for quite sometime and I like how these came out.

It was a beautiful day, thankfully not a "feels like 105 degrees" one. We went to see a friends new place. Mitch installed a doorbell cam for them. Afterwards a few of us hit Common Market for some sandwiches. I got the Dillworth Scandal and was also happy to see they had the Greatest Potato Chips in the World, aka kettle cooked pepperoncini chips. _Chef's kiss_.

Later we went over to RnR's for some pool time and BBQ. Great Saturday all-around.
