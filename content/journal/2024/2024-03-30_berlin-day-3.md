We slept in a bit as the previous day wiped us out. Had a good sized brunch before doing a {{< link href="http://sonderweg-berlin.de/en/our-tours/all-tours/queer-schoeneberg/" text="guided queer history tour" >}} in <span lang="de">Schöneberg</span> tour. Our guide Tobias is a walking encyclopedia of the area. A lot of the tour showed and talked about how the rise of the Nazis and WWI shaped queer life in Berlin. Very much recommend it.

At one point we came to this walled garden that looked to be very Japanese-inspired. I admit I kind of tuned out the tour and just started taking photos of this wall (and door. More doors!) Turns out it's <span lang="de">Das Kleine Grosz Museum</span> (The Small Grosz Museum), which seems to be {{< link href="https://www.daskleinegroszmuseum.berlin/" text="a small museum dedicated to George Grosz' work" >}}. And boy do I regret not visiting later. Next time!

Afterwards we explored <span lang="de">Schöneberg</span> and the shops. Berlin (and probably most other European cities with a scene) have _legit_ gear shops. There were so many leather men outfitted head to toe. I think I might be into leather. Tried on a shirt and it kinda felt right. Goes to Berlin once...

We had dinner at <span lang="it">Da Lucia</span> again which is sandwiched between Prinzknecht (a leather/gear bar) and WOOF (a bear bar), so the outdoor seating was a mixture of leather men in full gear, groups of pups, bears, and straight couples. I had Spaghetti Bolognese this time, and would definitely have it again.

A short side note of something I observed a few times in Berlin. Dogs are rarely on a leash, which I don't agree with, _however_, I have never seen more well-behaved dogs. They always stayed by their owners. We even saw a lady go into a grocery store, and her dog stopped at the door, sat down, and waited.

While at dinner, an older, well-dressed gentlemen, rode up on his bike. There were a lot of well-dressed older people on bikes (just another observation.) Anyway, he had a small dog in his bike's basket. He placed the dog on the ground and it went with him to their table. A little later, completely on it's own, I see the small dog walk over to a tree on the sidewalk. The dog relieves himself on the dirt, not the tree or the sidewalk, and then just walks back over to his owner and lays down. Children aren't even that well-behaved.

WOOF was _packed_. Was sweating my butt off in there. We met some nice guys. I was chatting with a nice ozzie gent for a while about his leather suit. He had to be dying in all that, but seemed comfortable enough.

It was a fun night, even though I couldn't really move for hours. Everyone is super nice.
