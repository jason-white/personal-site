We spent the day hanging out with Momma Davis and Timmy. Mostly plant shopping, and then stayed around the house until it was time to go view fireworks.

We found a good spot at the Best Buy parking lot up on a hill. It looks down on Altoona, and is a great view except for these massive street lights in the way. In my head I'd be able to get some long-ish exposure shots of fireworks going off in different areas of the town. It mostly worked, but those street lights kinda killed the vibe.

We were going to go to the otherside of the lot, where there may have been a better view, but then there was a massive downpour, so we just went back to Momma Davis' house.
