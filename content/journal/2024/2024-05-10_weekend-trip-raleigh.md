Spent a good bit of the day packing and cleaning around the house. I don't have a lot of this day recorded, as I wrote it in my offline journal a few days late. I'm also logging it to the site in late June. Eh, it happens.

Headed to Raleigh after Mitch finished work. Made it to John and Patrick's around 9:30 PM. Had some pizza and got to play Wandering Towers again. I really like this game. We played it for the first time at TantrumCon earlier this year. Which I am now realizing that I never made a post about! I'll link to it later.
