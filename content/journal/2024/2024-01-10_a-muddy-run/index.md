The sun was out, and if I don't get enough of it I feel cranky. So during lunch breaks I go for a 30 minute/~3 mile run. Somehow I forgot that we had a massive storm yesterday that gave us 3+ inches of rain. Getting to the greenway was easy enough, but more often than not I had to walk due to the amount of mud and water covering the paved path.

I still enjoyed it, and was just happy to get outside in the sun!

Later this evening we made it to the gym for the first time since December. Didn't get a whole lot in, but we still went, and that's matters. Our shed is still in the works, so the reality of a home gym is pretty far away.
