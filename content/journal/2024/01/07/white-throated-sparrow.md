Lots of housework today. Finally putting some pictures in frames. I didn't see a setting anywhere to turn this off, so beware ordering prints from Shutterfly. They crop in about 5-10%. Combine that with mats from ready-made picture frames, and you lose a bit of your photo. Some need to be reprinted but most are fine as they are.

Eventually went for a walk in the park next to our neighborhood. I expected a lot more bird activity, but this little sparrow was about it. Thankfully it was sitting very close and didn't seem to care about us. Normally the smaller birds won't sit still for you for more than three seconds.
