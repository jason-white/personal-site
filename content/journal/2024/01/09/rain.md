I wasn't even aware it was supposed to rain today. Let alone an entire storm that covered the whole east coast. Our iPhones blared flash flood warnings multiple times. A tornado apparently touched down right beside our neighborhood, right around the same time we were chasing down our trash bins before they were blown into a neighbors car. We made it through the entire day with no loss of power...until right after work.

On the plus side, we had dinner with Ryan and Robbie at Phở Hương Que, a Vietnamese place I'd never been to. Phở was a solid choice.

Also, I am now much farther into my January book; {{< link href="https://www.librarything.com/work/11640" text="The Contortionists Handbook" >}}, which is very good so far.

The power didn't come back on until 3:00 AM. We know because when the power comes back on, the Hue bulbs in our nightstand lamps turn back on at full brightness.
