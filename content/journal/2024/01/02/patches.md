Over my winter break I started to sew some patches on this denim jacket I got for a steal. I've always wanted to make a battle jacket, but not go too overboard. Over Christmas, my dad gave me his Sho-Bud patch. I don't play the pedal steel guitar, but I like it on the jacket so I think of him when I see it.

Side note: matching thread colors is a little more difficult than I thought it would be.
