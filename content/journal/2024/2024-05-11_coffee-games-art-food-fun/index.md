Had a fantastic day around Raleigh. Started with a big breakfast at Barry's, a fireman-themed joint. Everything was super good, I ate so much.

Then we headed downtown, because you know I have to hit up Black & White Coffee. I bought a lot of bags that I will try to make last. No promises. I can't remember what they had on drip this day, but it was delicious.

Boxcar (a barcade) is right across the street, so we headed over to play some games. It was really fun, mostly because it wasn't packed. It's usually difficult to even walk around this place, let alone find a game to actually play.

Then it was off to the North Carolina Museum of Art. I haven't been here since high school. It has a new addition, and I got to see a couple of Alec Soth prints in person. Nobody else makes you want to shoot large format like Alec Soth. It must have been prom season, because a lot of young people in tuxedos and dresses were having their pictures taken around the grounds.

Later this evening Mitch had reservations at Bida Manda for my bithday. This place is so so good! Everything we had was very tasty, but I could not get enough of the lemongrass sausage. Highly recommended restaurant if you're in the area.

After dinner we met everyone at the new Flex location. It's unfortunate they had to move. The original Flex was my first gay bar experience, and the space was perfect. It had so much character that was developed over time. The new location honestly looks like a Texas Roadhouse.
