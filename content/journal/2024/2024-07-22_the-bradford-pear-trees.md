The entrance to our cul-de-sac used to be flanked by these Bradford Pear trees, creating a beautiful flowered arch in the Spring. As lovely as it was, there are just too many problems with these trees. After three branches have fallen from the two in our yard, one almost taking out my car, we cut them down. Yeah, it ruined that lovely entrance, but they had to go. Some neighbors didn't like this.

Those very neighbors understand now.
