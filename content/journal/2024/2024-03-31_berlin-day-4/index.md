Slept in again, and almost missed Drag Brunch at the Social Club. The food was pretty good, the entertainment wasn't bad, either. The host was a queen from America, going by the name of Rachel Intervention. The Social Club itself is a really cool and unique establishment. Very colorful.

Headed back to the apartment to nap before going out again. It's Easter Sunday and not a lot of businesses are open. We ate at some poke bowl place that looked like a chain of sorts. There were a lot of options and it was very good.

Tonights event was Unshaved, another bear dance party. This time at Gretchen Club. Our cab driver dropped us off in this very abandoned looking gravel parking lot. She even asked "are you sure", to which we replied "...yeah... It's around here. Somewhere." And it was, but to be honest the whole area at night looked abandoned. There were a couple of mechanics garages, definitely (maybe?) an abandoned grocery store, and then the building we would line up to get into. I'm exaggerating a little, but it was dark and I'm a tourist.

We arrived early since we did not have tickets. Worst case was we go back to WOOF if we couldn't get in. Well, we did get in, and I had a blast. I danced for 4 hours straight. I never dance. Ever. This may have been the most fun night out I've ever had.

Also, I made a {{< link href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71D1n29INCejCtMGhcxNfs?si=5df4173a188e49bd" text="playlist of every single song that was played while we were there" >}}, except for maybe one or two obscure remixes, but I improvised. I think only one song wasn't on Spotify at all.
