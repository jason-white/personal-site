Woke up pretty late. Davis and Patrick went out and got everyone some tasty bagels. Mitch and I headed back downtown a little later. I wanted to hit up Black & White again, as well as check out Sorry State Records. It's a small record shop with a really great selection. Especially the used section. I snagged a copy of {{< link href="https://album.link/s/57h5IDkgYnV5AZV5PU97xN" text="Drab Majesty's The Demonstration" >}} and really nice copy of {{< link href="https://album.link/s/1weenld61qoidwYuZ1GESA" text="Miles Davis' Kind of Blue." >}}

The Mr. Bungle show was a lot of fun. I didn't know who would be opening, and with Ipecac Records being involved, I was sure we'd be in for a treat. First up was King Garbage, who, if I recall are from Raleigh. They have some impressive production credits, as {{< link href="https://new.ipecac.com/artists/king-garbage" text="Ipecac's site" >}} puts it, they have "quietly impacted pop, R&B and hip hop." They were really fun, and I feel like seeing them live is the way to go.

Second opener was {{< link href="https://new.ipecac.com/artists/otto-von-schirach" text="Otto von Schirach" >}}, which I'm not sure I can explain, but was by far the most entertaining set of the night. It was somewhere between performance art, Miami bass, noise, gabber and glitch. At the same time.

Mr. Bungle sounded incredible, as expected. I've seen Mike Patton perform with Trevor Dunn and Dave Lombardo a few times with Fantomas. But, seeing Scott Ian and Trey Spruance playing guitar live was something else. The set was all death metal and thrash with no other Bungle styles mixed in, which was expected. They played {{< link href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/mr-bungle/2024/the-ritz-raleigh-nc-73abbae1.html" text="some killer covers" >}} with a hilarious version of Summer Breeze thrown in.

Also, happy Mother's Day, Mom!
