Worked on the site a bit more today. Feels good to start knocking things off the list.

Dropped a bunch of shorts off to be stitched up. The tailor was right next to Eddie's Place, which we've not been to in ages. Great breakfast/brunch spot. I remember their grits being much better, but everything else was super good. I ordered too much. While we waited for our table to be ready we checked out Rebel Base Comics & Toys. Cool spot, overflowing with geekery. They also have some amazing vintage toys in glass cases. There was an original Optimus Prime I was excited to see, plus many others. Also some great Gunpla options!

Had game night at Matt and Allen's later. We all ordered pizza from The Crust, who makes these personal-sized pizzas that are absolutely packed with toppings. It's almost too much. _Almost._

Ticket to Ride was super fun. I don't usually rave about a particular boardgame, they're more or less just a fun thing to do while hanging with friends, but I would love to play this one again.
