We've had an awful lot of hummingbird activity as of late. One in particular keeps guarding the feeders like it's his single purpose in life. He will stay perched up in our magnolia tree, and then swoop down if another hummingbird tries to access the feeder.

There's enough for everyone, little guy!

Anyway, this is maybe the only bird photo I've taken this year. I quite like it, even though it isn't close (this is a hefty crop.) It shows the scale of the bird, and I also like the composition. Lightroom's AI denoise came in clutch.

I'm not super happy with the image quality when attempting to make smaller file sizes for the site. Still trying to find balance.
