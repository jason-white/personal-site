Knocked out a good bit of work on this site today. I'm writing this pretty late, so I'm not entirely sure what part I was working on. I suppose I could go through Git logs, but...nah.

Watched the Apple keynote. Nothing got me too excited. The only thing I really want from Apple is a 27 inch model of the XDR display, but with speakers. The Studio display is fantastic, but I have the earlier LG 5k which is the same panel, and I don't know if it's just my copy, but it has serious burn-in issues if something stays on the screen too long. Too long being about 5 minutes.

Started working on a new {{< link href="https://mtgcommander.net/index.php/rules/" text="Commander deck" >}} because we have a trip coming up and a couple of friends are going to want to play. I cut that a little short. The weather was very nice and we decided to go for a walk.

Kinda wasted the rest of the evening.
