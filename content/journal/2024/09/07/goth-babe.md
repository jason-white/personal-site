Sam and I went to get everyone coffee. Asheville Roasting Company was close by. We had other plans for food, but the breakfast there looked fantastic. The place is ran by the sweetest couple you'll ever meet, and the coffee was pretty good, too! Very smooth.

We headed back downtown to have breakfast at Early Girl. It was a fairly chilly, but nice morning, so we opted to eat outside. I had some kind of bowl with pulled pork, potatoes and fried eggs. It was _so_ good. The BBQ reminded me a lot of my dad's when he cooks a whole hog for large parties.

Then we hit the Riverview Arts district, and looked at all of the art. All of it. Mitch bought some cute ceramics that looked like little brains. We headed back to the house after a lot of walking around, and played a round of Creature Comforts. Super cute game, that I think anyone would enjoy. A few things to learn, but it plays easy enough, and doesn't take a ton of time. Maybe an hour?

Headed to see Goth Babe at Rabbit Rabbit, a downtown venue. It was really nice, and the sound was excellent. The show was great, I didn't take a single photo, though! Not sure why. There was this weird part at the end that I guess counted as an encore? They clearly had more time to play but decided to jam some techno over the PA, dance around the stage and hype the crowd instead.

After the show, we headed over to some bar that was a little too packed and a little too loud for my tastes. We dipped a little early while some other friends carried on. ðŸ«¡

Our Lyft driver was _super_ weird. He kinda looked like Anthony Geary in UHF, pointed out cops for no reason, and told us some story where he made a kidnapping joke while giving a ride to some poor woman _while he was taking a different route to get to her destination._ Not gonna lie, I was a little worried letting him see where we were staying.
