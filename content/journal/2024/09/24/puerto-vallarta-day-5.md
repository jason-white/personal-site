I needed to find an ATM, and Ross recommended a good location that's indoors and always open. He also showed me how to avoid nasty fees. In return, I took him to Puerto Cafe. I couldn't pass up another chance to go there again. This time I had a cortado along with the same V60 pour over as before. Sooo good. One of the baristas today is a photographer, and his Mamiya RB67 was sitting in the corner. Wish I had more time to hang out, but we were on a schedule.

We returned to the villa for a four hand massage. I've never been so relaxed in my life. That was the equivalent of 42 naps at once.

There was some time to further relax by the pool. Some people were getting massages, others were on an ATV trip. After everyone had returned and showered, it was down to the beach/lounge area to have a nice toast to celebrate John's birthday while the sun set.

A <span lang="en">piñata</span> was then setup for the birthday boy to break open. This <span lang="en">piñata</span> must have been forged by the Aztec gods themselves. It took 5 grown men, and two sticks to bust it open. The first stick broke, and I'm pretty sure it was made from bamboo. The man controlling the rope was having an absolute blast.

The birthday dinner and celebration were all fantastic.
