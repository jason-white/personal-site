A couple of years ago we agreed to join John and Patrick, as well as others, in Puerto Vallarta to celebrate John's 50th. We thought it sounded like a great time, and said we're in. The time had finally come! We've never been to PV, but have always heard great things from friends.

Woke up at 2:00am. Lyft pickup at 3:00am. Made it to the airport by 3:30am. Our flights were easy. Landed in Dallas on time, but there was a tight window to get to the next gate. Thankfully there was a bit of a delay.

Landed Puerto Vallarta. As we began to touch down, heavy rain started to hit the window. It's the off season, so a lot of rain is to be expected.

The humidity is next level.

Thanks to the delay, we didn't have to wait very long for everyone else's flights to show up. Patrick arranged for a bus to shuttle us up to our destination. The 44 of us piled in. We eventually had to be split up into a few sprinter vans because the bus can't make it up the tight, winding hills to reach our villa.

The villa is quite amazing. Breathtaking? Maybe, but that could also be the humidity.

Everyone was running on little sleep, so after dinner most of us crashed. Our room looks out to a small infinity pool, and then the ocean. Even with the doors fully closed you can hear the waves all night.
