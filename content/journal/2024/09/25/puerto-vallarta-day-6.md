Woke up, had coffee and a nice breakfast. Took in the amazing view from the villa one more time.

While packed and waiting for our shuttle, in the library/pool table room, we noticed Hurricane Helene brewing in the gulf.

Our flights were mostly OK. From PV to Dallas was painless, but Dallas to Charlotte was a usual crowded American airport mess, plus a lot of turbulance on the flight home.

We made it to our house around midnight. There was no food, and we were starving. We didn't want to stop the authentic Mexican cuisine train just yet, so we went to Taco Bell.

Puerto Vallarta was a lot of fun. I can't thank John and Patrick enough for inviting us. Patrick especially gets a gold star for putting the whole thing together. The level of organization was impressive. Big kudos to that man.

We will be back, for sure.
