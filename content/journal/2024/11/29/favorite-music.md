What a fantastic year of music! Even though I stayed on top of it a lot better than last year, it seems like I still missed so much. There are a lot of albums I come across that I will listen to over and over, making it difficult to constantly tune into everything that comes my way. But, I think that's how you _should_ listen to music. Just keep playing what you enjoy until something else catches your ear, then jam on that for a while.

It's interesting looking back on a whole year of music, because you have some standouts for sure, but then there are all of the other albums that make you go "Oh yeah! I totally forgot that came out this year!" Misha Panfilov had two albums in 2024, and according to Last.fm, he was my third most played artist. But, I kinda forgot about those until I started focusing on this here roundup. One of my top artists of all-time, Underworld put out a new album, and I'm just now being reminded of it while writing this. I think I played it once. And that's not because I didn't enjoy it, I was just too busy rocking out to Curta'n Wall singing about hill forts and unicorn horns.

Then there are all the singles that I listen to over and over, rather than check out the full album. I make a new playlist each year titled _Discovery_, and some weeks I'll shuffle that playlist for days. I've also been working on an All Time Favorite Songs playlist, which I will also shuffle every-now-and-again.

But anywho, let's get started with my favorite albums. I don't like ranking things, so here's a list in chronological order. I thought about adding a section with my album of the year choice, but that slowly started to becoming two, possibly _three_ albums of the year before I said to hell with it, and just lumped them all together.

If you _really_ want to know, it was between 1999 Write the Future's _hella <code>(˃̣̣̥╭╮˂̣̣̥) ✧ ♡ ‧º·˚:</code>_, and Blood Incantation's _Absolute Elsewhere_.
