I keep waking up too late, but also going to bed too late. Funny how that works.

We had breakfast at Tom and Joe's. I love this place! It looks like it hasn't changed since the day it opened, probably. The food is always good and the coffee is tolerable.

We packed in a bit of stuff today. Went thrifting with the family for a bit. Saw some interesting pieces with actual good prices, but didn't buy anything.

After, Mitch and I headed to Canoe Creek, but first we checked out the Hollidaysburg overlook. At least I think that's what it was called. It definitely overlooks Hollidaysburg. Canoe Creek was kind of dead, but it was nice to walk the trails that route by the water. Just before entering the park, there's this beautiful little road you take that winds around some farms. Lots of horses. I wanted to try and get a large format shot of some, but they weren't close and the shots came out very mid. I exposed three sheets, and they were all pretty terrible.

Then we met the family at The Meadows, an ice cream joint that's been in the area since the 1950s. I had a strawberry shortcake, and it was very good.

An aside; isn't it so great that I can go back and look at what I was listening to on July 5th to keep the jammin' section accurate? Gosh Last.fm is the best!
