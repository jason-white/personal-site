Had a decent day. Ran another 5k and had a chat with Stephanie. Our monthly coffee chat lives on! It was great catching up.

After Mitch finished work we met the guys over at Matt and Allen's house to car pool to Cheat's. I will never turn down Cheat's, but holy moly, those are some pricey cheese steak sandwiches.

Hung out at VGBG's a bit before the show. A friend of a friend bumped us up to nearly the front row, so that was cool. Also I forgot that {{< link href="https://song.link/s/6W9rbkBueZQrwuzO24GHZ2" text="Durand Jones" >}} was one of the openers, which made everything even better. That man can sing! They did not play the song with Aaron Frazer that I linked, but this is one of my all-time favorites, and everyone should listen to it.

Orville put on a hell of a show. They played some covers. {{< link href="https://song.link/s/5rKTGQ2Q1wndZnX7km8WYu" text="Cowboys are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other" >}} of course, but they also performed a really solid cover of Elton John's Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting.)

Orville is always a good time, and I can't wait to see him again! ðŸ¤
