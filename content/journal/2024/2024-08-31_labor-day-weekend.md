The drive to Raleigh was easy enough. When we arrived at the hotel, there was some kind of massive church festival going on. A little chaotic. This Marriott (City Center) is really nice, and it must be fairly new. It's a great location and walking distance to some favorite spots.

Tim and Kevin arrived a little after, a couple doors down from our room.

We hit up Heirloom first. This was a place Tim and Kevin remember when they were hanging with Brian and Jeremie during Raleigh Pride last year, I believe. Everyone said it was really good, and they weren't kidding. Highly recommended. I had a chicken thigh bowl. Simple enough, but bursting with flavor. Their coffee selection was too good to pass up. I had a pour over made with some tasty Kenyan bean juice. Kenyan beans are my all-time favorite coffee, and this one was _delicious_.

After lunch we walked over to Boxcar. It's kind of a group outing staple when you're in Raleigh. Nothing to do? Go play some games! They have just about anything you'd be interested in. Unfortunately for me, the controls on Street Fighter II were borked. So I stuck with pinball and Galaga, mostly.

Our friends Jeff and Johnny were having a pool party, so we eventually headed over to their house. They are always incredible hosts! To our surprise there were quite a few people from Charlotte as well as a few friends from Raleigh that we haven't seen in over a year. It was great seeing and catching up with everyone and, the food was fantastic.
