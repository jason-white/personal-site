The photo above was originally for an update on January 14, when I hit seven years without a drop of alcohol.

Been redesigning this site since early (earlier than now) this year. It's going. I've scrapped a few ideas and decided to worry about fixing all the bugs and accessibility issues first. There are a lot of things I was sort of manually doing in Hugo that could have been setup in a more programmatic way. Also, I had a few accessibility issues to fix. I'd rather these things be addressed before worrying about a pretty layout.

I guess the other day I got to {{< link href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/research/bite/" text="the Bite" >}} and just started knocking things out.

## Some other things

- The weather is getting nice.
- Our shed is up (yay!) and the deck should start soon!
- Heading to Berlin in a couple of weeks.
- Can't stop listening to {{< link href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7nAFPtoN75FBt8WA0CQoBQ?si=2IX-Tch-TxeddvQ-jBk9PQ" text="1999 Write the Future." >}}
- Watched Dune 2. Liked it a whole lot.

I did finish {{< link href="https://www.librarything.com/work/27351724" text="Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow" >}}, and it was very good. Picked up the {{< link href="https://www.librarything.com/work/11640" text="Contortionist's Handbook" >}} for January. Fantastic and very Palahniuk. Then decided for February I'd finally read a book from a high school friend, Chris; {{< link="https://www.librarything.com/work/25444039" text="Calling Mr. Nelson Pugh." >}} It takes quite a turn. I really enjoyed it, and I hope he writes more! For March, I think I'll finally finish Seth Godin's {{< link href="https://www.librarything.com/work/25614330" text="The Practice." >}} I read about half and then seemed to have moved onto something else and forgotten about it. I do have quite a few pages dog-eared. Maybe I should start the book over. I've been doing so much accessibility reading for work, that I should probably count all of it for my March "book."
