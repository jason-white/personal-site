Honestly didn't do much all day. Which is what you're supposed to do at the beach, I think.

My parents and Aunt Rita showed up a little later. Mitch helped my dad change the battery in the golf cart. It was a simple task that became difficult after a small screw fell underneath another part, and we ended up having to remove this whole basepalte underneath. Bad design, I guess.

We also setup some security cameras, but it felt pointless after trying to get the horrible app setup.

Had a nice dinner at River View. It was kind of meh, actually. It's usually really good, but maybe that's because I got steak instead of seafood.

This is my first time shooting Acros II and I really like the results. I developed it in HC110, I can't recall the dillution. I think I shot the whole roll on the 50mm Summilux.
