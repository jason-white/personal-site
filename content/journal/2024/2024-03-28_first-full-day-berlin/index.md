I had this French client who always showed up to my flat immaculately dressed on a Monday afternoon. He liked to listen to Edith Piaf, huff poppers and get fisted. I'd be there, elbow-deep in his hairy ass, thinking 'what is my life?!' I've since introduced them to a lot of straight clients. You have to be careful though. I once passed the bottle to a client, looked over and he was drinking them!'"

Slept in, as expected. We had quite a day planned so there was no time for dillying _or_ dallying, no. We showered up and popped over to a cafe a couple of doors down. The coffee was OK.

We then walked over the Spree river via the SpreebrÃ¼cke Bahnhof FriedrichstraÃŸe, a bridge underneath the {{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe_station" text="FriedrichstraÃŸe train station" >}}. We were headed to Ama's Cafe for brunch. The food was good. I had a salmon and avocado bagel with a coffee. The coffee was kinda meh.

We decided now would be a good time to hit a grocery store before taking on the rest of our itinerary for the day. There was an Aldi on the way back. I absolutely had to grab one of these cute, tiny shopping buggies.

Dropped off groceries, and then it was time to visit the {{< link href="https://www.schwulesmuseum.de/" text="Schwules Museum" >}}, an LGBT museum located just north of SchÃ¶neberg. The current exhibit covers the history of sex work in Berlin. I think the rest of the gallery towards the back of the space is their permanent collection, but I could be wrong. Some very interesting pieces.

I don't know how I forgot to mention this in my offline journal, but we made it over to this Japanese denim shop, {{< link href="https://dc4.de/" text="DC4" >}}. I've never set foot in a place like this. The space alone was really cool. I've been a bit of a denim head for many years. I knew of every brand they carried, but it was so cool to see some of these pieces in person. I wasn't planning on buying anything, but I saw this really cool t-shirt from Samurai Jeans that was extremely heavy weight for a t-shirt. It was made from their own cotton fields in Japan. Very slubby in texture. I love it. The guy running the shop was very polite and informative. I will be back, for sure.

I spent too much time at DC4, so we had to quickly head back to the apartment to get ready for the {{< link href="https://www.berliner-philharmoniker.de/en/concerts/calendar/details/55552/" text="NÃ¼rnberger Symphony at the Berlin Philharmonic" >}}. _Stunning_ venue. Inside and out. A wonderful experience and is something that Mitch and I probably wouldn't have done on our own, so I'm glad Brian and Jeremie wanted to go. I was not supposed to take that photo, so ðŸ¤«.

To end the night we went to {{< link href="https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/berzt-the-ritz-carlton-berlin/dining/" text="The Lounge" >}} inside of the Ritz-Carlton. We were not aware it was inside of the hotel until we got there. I'm glad I was dressed up a little. Otherwise I would have felt very out of place. They had some wonderful mocktails on the menu. The two that I had were so delicious. A mango chili something something, and a berry lemonade.

A very good first day.
