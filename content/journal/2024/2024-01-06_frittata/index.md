Rain. Just nonstop rain since before we even went to bed last night. We didn't do a whole lot and I guess that's OK. With both of us fighting a cold and Mitch's back pain, why not just watch football and eat pizza?

This frittata was the only thing worth taking a photo of today. It was also very tasty.
