Tuesday kind of blends into Wednesday because we time traveled into the future via Airbus.

We all piled into a cab to our AirBnB, and quickly decided on a place to eat. We were dead-tired, but needed food. There's a nice Italian place Jeremie found, called Da Lucia, at the northern edge of {{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6neberg" text="SchÃ¶neberg" >}}, the LGBT neighborhood. Their specialty seems to be pizza, and it did not disappoint. Everything was super good. I had a ham and mushroom pizza, some minestrone, and we finished with a couple of desserts. The tiramisu was served in a Mokapot, which was totally a {{< link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantPlates/" text="We Want Plates" >}} moment, but it was so tasty I didn't care to poke fun.

Just a small observation, but everyone in the restaurant was eating their pizza with a fork and knife. They didn't slice it for you. I was starving, so of course I cut my pie into quarters and inhaled it.

Da Lucia is right beside WOOF, a bear bar, so we decided to check it out. It opened at 9:00pm and within less than 30 minutes it started to fill up. We didn't stay long, as we all needed some much deserved sleep. We met two other Americans. They both met at the airport while flying from Amsterdam (I think?) Adam and Duke. We would end up seeing both of them throughout the week at various events.

Went back to the apartment around 10:00pm and crashed _hard_. We're talking next level sleep.
