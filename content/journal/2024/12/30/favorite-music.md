What a fantastic year of music! Even though I stayed on top of it better than last year, it feels like I still missed so much.

Looking back on a whole year of music is always interesting. There are some clear standouts, but then there are all those other albums that make you go, "Oh yeah! I totally forgot that came out this year!" Underworld, one of my all-time favorite artists, released a new album—but I may have listened to it only once. It’s not that I didn’t enjoy it; I was just too busy rocking out to Curta’n Wall singing about hill forts and unicorn horns.

So let’s dive into it. Here's all the music I dug in 2024. I don’t like ranking things, so the list is in chronological order. I considered an "Album of the Year" section, but decided against it. It was pretty much between 1999 Write the Future's _hella <code>(˃̣̣̥╭╮˂̣̣̥) ✧ ♡ ‧º·˚:</code>_, and Blood Incantation's _Absolute Elsewhere_.

Some of these probably deserve to be in the Favorites list after I really dig into them. I just learned of Dana and Alden the other day. And the new Cure album is _amazing_, I just haven't really gotten around to listening to it a whole lot yet. I bet I listened to that Letherette EP almost 200 times.

## Discovery 2024 Spotify Playlist

Every year I add songs to a playlist that I really like, and have never heard before. This years is a lot larger than the last. It's easier than making a long list of every single that I enjoyed playing over and over again all year. If I could call out one song, though? The Beaches - Takes One to Know One. That's my Single of the Year, I guess.
