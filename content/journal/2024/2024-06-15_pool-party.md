First pool party of the season at Robbie and Ryan's, and it was a good one. I ate way too much junk food (Matt and Allen's Nutter Butter Banana Pudding was _too_ good.) We left a little late. I was tired so the best option was to order pizza. I waited for it to arrive, but fell asleep soon after. I woke up around 2:30am completely thinking I closed my eyes for maybe five minutes.

I went back to sleep. The pizza was perfectly fine the next day after a good air frying.
