Had a good sleep, as expected after dancing all night. We walked over to Refinery for coffee and breakfast. Refinery is probably the best coffee shop we found here. This was our second trip.

We did a lot of walking today. Went to see the <span lang="de">Brandenburger Tor</span> ({{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate" text="Brandenburg Gate" >}}) first. The hotel nearby is the one that Michael Jackson held Blanket out of a window. Mitch did some detective work and found the exact window, matching the markings on the facade. We walked through the <span lang="de">Denkmal f√ºr die ermordeten Juden Europas</span> ({{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe" text="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe." >}}) A huge, disorienting piece. Intentionally so.

We eventually made it to the <span lang="de">Berlinische Galerie</span>. Such a {{< link href="https://berlinischegalerie.de/en/" text="beautiful modern art museum." >}} We looked at everything. The only name I recognized was Otto Dix.

On the way back we stopped at a tapas restaurant for our last dinner in Berlin. It was kind of mid, but only the atmosphere. The place was almost completely empty, due to the Easter holiday if anything. The food was really good, though the menu was massive with some items repeated in different sections which was a little confusing. Bacon wrapped dates are certainly a new favorite.

We headed back to the apartment to clean and back. Went to bed super early as we all needed to be at the airport in a few hours.

Sadly no elevator selfie in this post.
