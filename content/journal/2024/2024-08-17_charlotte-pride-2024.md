I didn't really take a lot of photos during pride this year. Wasn't really feeling it. Also it's just really hot here in August, and I'd love for them to move it. Though if it ever conflicted with Atlanta Pride, we would probably never make it to our own here in Charlotte.

Once again, less and less religious fanatics trying to ruin the fun. Always a good sign. I don't know if this here "Need Prayer?" guy was an ally or not, but I never appreciate anyone pushing religion on people. We kindly declined his offer and kept moving.
