We're hanging at my parents for the weekend while my sister is in town. It's also my niece's birthday, so they're all hanging at the beach with my mom while Mitch and I crashed at the house with my dad.

We set up a little space for Mitch to work on Friday while I met the family at Mirey Creek for lunch. At some point Phyllis' grandson put me in Kid Jail. I'm not sure what the charge was, but to kill time I thumbed through this book, 14,000 Things To Be Happy About. It is not a good book.
