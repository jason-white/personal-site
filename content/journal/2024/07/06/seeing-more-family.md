Saturday was pretty chill. Mitch helped his brother upgrade his computer. Timmy bought a new graphics card. A 4070 I think, I don't really keep up with PC parts these days, but it seemed like a huge upgrade.

Timmy also hooked me up with some photo reflectors he got, but has no use for them. I can't wait to try them in the sunroom/studio when that's setup.

Made a quick trip to Bellwood to see Mitch's sister, and her new shop. Bellwood is such a cute town, and reminds me a lot of Richlands where I grew up.

Then we hit up Houser's for some subs. This place is such a gem. The subs are super good, and it's kinda sorta a small grocer as well.

Then it was back to Momma Davis' to hang out and see more family that was coming over. The weather was pretty nice in the evening and it felt good to sit outside. People are still setting off fireworks. Some of which are directly behind the house. It's kind of annoying, but also sorta fun. The kids are loving it.
