Woke up, showered and finished packing. Then headed to Momma Davis' to say goodbye and get some family pics. The neighbors super cute dog was lounging on the porch. I should have gotten closer, but I still kind of like the photo I got.

The drive home, my half of it at least, was so awful. Five to six traffic jams and then a massive storm over Charlotte that night. The rain was heavy and non-stop. I almost hydroplaned off an exit when trying to take an easier route off the highway. Only to realize shortly after that Google Maps put us right back on the same route.
