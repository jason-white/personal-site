In January lots of friends have birthdays so we will typically try and do one big dinner when we can. This wasn't all that doable over the last couple of years, so doing something new and fun was in order! I've never had Korean BBQ before but I loved everything. The corn and cheese in the little tin cups were especially delicious.

I could eat curried pork belly every. Single. Day.
