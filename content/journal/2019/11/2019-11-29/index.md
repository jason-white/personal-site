Much earlier this year my friend Ryan asked us if we'd like to drive up to DC and see Deadmau5 around Thanksgiving.

I didn't know what to think at first as far as seeing Deadmau5 live, goes. But a trip to DC always sounds like a good time.

There ended up being eight of us and we decided to rent a shuttle van to make the trip up, which everyone agrees was a fantastic idea. The van was roomy and comfortable enough. The side door was very difficult to ~~close~~ slam shut. Leaning on it was a _risk_.

The show was at the Anthem. A massive indoor venue on the waterfront, just south of the National Mall. I had no idea what to expect a Deadmau5 show to be like, and honestly I was kind of blown away. The sound, the [Cube V3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waGzVes6PWY), the lights and the crowd were all just...perfect? Even Captain America showed up dressed as Deadmau5.

As an aside, the iPhone 11's night mode feature is quite amazing.
