Like most others, we've been laying low. Only trips to the grocery store or Costco for essential items. Haven't seen any friends in person for weeks. Our only real way to get out and about is to walk in the park by our neighborhood. It helps.

I try to focus on any positives there may be during all of this. I'm fortunate to have a quarantine buddy and a job that allows me to work from home. A few small projects have been started, like this website (finally.) 

I'm a very introverted person, so keeping busy at home isn't really a problem. But let's hope we're back to "normal" by 2021.
