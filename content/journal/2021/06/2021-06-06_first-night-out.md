We spent this weekend in Raleigh. Going out of town for a night out made things a little more exciting, I guess. It was so good to hang out with friends we hadn't seen in well over a year. Even better? Hugs. I'm a hugger.

The place wasn't terribly packed, which for some reason made it feel more "safe?" The more days that go by with restrictions lifted the more normal everything feels.
