Spring has certainly sprung here in the south. All three of the photos in this post are from different areas of North Carolina. Charlotte, Jacksonville and Raleigh. I wish I had a more pleasant reason for traveling all over the state this month, but the truth is, April was a tough one. I lost four people in my life. Losing someone is never easy. Losing multiple people within days apart from each other is especially hard.

I've still been making photographs, though, not any that I'd likely share on this site. Mostly I've been documenting friends and family as much as I can. The importance of {{< link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSjkBZkEilE" text="documenting your life" >}} has felt stronger than ever. One thing I've been doing is making prints for family via {{< link href="https://www.costcophotocenter.com/Home.aspx" text="Costco's photo center" >}}. You can't beat the price and the shipping is free.

I supported {{< link href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1436129614/the-intrepid-compact-enlarger-print-and-scan-35mm-and-120" text="Intrepid's Kickstarter" >}} for their enlarger, so hopefully, in the near future I'll be able to make darkroom prints for people. They've created something really unique and special. It's very compact and uses LED's for adjusting contrast. Really cool stuff. And you can store in a shoebox.
