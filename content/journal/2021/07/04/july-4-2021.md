The weekend was spent hanging by pools, seeing friends from out of town and fireworks. Lots of (illegal) fireworks. A couple buddies of ours recently moved into a new house and their neighbors put on a bit of a fireworks show. A lot of them were impressive, however, the really impressive ones seemed to go off while not very high in the air. You should definitely _not_ be able to get a photograph of fireworks that close with a 35mm lens.
