The {{< link href="https://vangoghexpo.com/" text="Van Gogh Immersive Experience" >}} exhibit was a unique way to celebrate the work of the late, great impressionist. The exhibit was available in many locations across the globe. At the time of writing this post about a month late, tickets are still available at most. The Charlotte location was at {{< link href="https://camp.nc/" text="Camp North End" >}}, more specifically in the old {{< link href="https://camp.nc/about/history/" text="Model T factory" >}}. Which makes sense of all the sculptures made from car parts and sunflowers.

The show was definitely _immersive_. At least 15-20 foot walls and floors blanketed in Van Gogh's more well-known imagery. The soundtrack certainly added a level of ambience. They even made an official {{< link href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/70NmdlovVHj8GE74XFdZbM" text="Spotify playlist" >}}. The combination of audio and visuals made for a very memorable experience.

I should also note this is the first time shooting Kodak XX (5222), a black and white cinema film. It's a variable speed film, "box rated" at 200-250 depending on if you're shooting in daylight or under artificial light. It has a nice look to it, I'm enjoying the contrast. I got about 100 feet of this from a friend. A few of us went in on a 400' roll and one was nice enough to split it up for us. This particular roll I developed in HC110, which I plan on using a lot more in the future. DDX is fantastic, but it's hardly bulk-friendly.
