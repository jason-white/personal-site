This was originally going to be another photo walk post, but the images from that day were basically the same as the last one. I do really like this photo I snapped of Mitch. I've been playing with these film presets from {{< link href="https://www.reallyniceimages.com/" text="RNI">}}. This one is "Kodak Gold 800." Did they ever even make Kodak Gold in 800 iso? {{< link href="http://www.photographyreview.com/product/film/print-film/kodak/gold-max-800.html" text="Guess so">}}. Doesn't look like it was too well received.

Anyway, I really like how this came out. The grain was added in Photoshop which I like doing more than using Lightroom's built in grain adjustments. I find those settings to be terribly unnatural.
