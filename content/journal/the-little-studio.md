For our anniversary this year we took a ceramics course at {{< link href="https://www.thelittlestudioclt.com/" text="The Little Studio." >}} Mitch has been wanting to try his hand at throwing pottery for a while now, and since things are somewhat back to normal, this year worked out. The staff was polite and very knowledgeable. We enjoyed it so much I believe we're going to sign up for a whole course!
