Like most others, we've been laying low. Only trips to the grocery store or Costco for essential items. Haven't seen any friends in person for weeks. Most places are restocked with everything, but in the beginning it was pretty sparse.

I try to focus on any positives there may be during all of this. I'm fortunate to have a quarantine buddy and a job that allows me to work from home. A few small projects have been started. Almost all meals have been prepared at home. After work we go for walks or bike rides in the park by our neighborhood.
