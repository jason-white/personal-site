Braved Costco on a Sunday. The house is severely lacking in Christmas decorations. We found a small tree to put beside the front door (not pictured.) We also got a new faucet for the kitchen sink (also not pictured, but here is Mitch installing it.) 

Later I made some chili with stew beef, which I've not used for chili before. It was really good, so this may be what I stick with. The key if not slow or pressure cooking is to cut the chunks of beef smaller, then sear the beef in small batches not to over-crowd the pan. The best recipes are almost always more time-consuming. It's worth it.

Spent the rest of the night scanning photos, watching Argentina vs Mexico and then the Packers vs the Eagles.
