Woke up a little late. Missed the Jordan 1 Chicago draw because the SNKRS app kept failing. Got ready to head to brunch at this place called Craft. Before we left, Greg had the news on. A little girl was hit by a pickup truck in the Raleigh Christmas parade. She was taken to the hospital but not sure what the outcome was.

We arrived at Craft and ran into Tim, Darious, Chase, Ethan and Jay. They recommended the breakfast pizza as an appetizer.

The breakfast pizza had sausage gravy as a "sauce" and was topped with eggs, cheese, pepporoni and Italian sausage. Damn. As good as that was, my French toast was even better.

Headed over to Black and White coffee, because I can't visit Raleigh and not buy too much coffee here. Also, Luke met some dogs.

Later we headed to Jason's. A lot of people had already shown up. Lots of friends we hadn't seen in years. The food was fantastic. I ate too much.

A few of us went in on a Solo Stove fire pit as a house warming gift. We used it all night and I can definitely recommend them.
