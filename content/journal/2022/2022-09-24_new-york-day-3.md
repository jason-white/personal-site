I have no idea who those two men are.

Hit {{< link href="http://www.blackfoxcoffee.com/" text="Black Fox" >}} again for coffee and a snack. Then back to the hotel to get ready to see some of the Leica Discord crew in SoHo. SoHo was a quick train ride away and the restaurant, {{< link href="https://momoyanyc.com/soho.html" text="Momoya" >}}, was only a block up from where we got off.

I love the subway.

Yofred was kind enough to make us reservations. He, Mitch and I were seated upstairs. Jon and his wife, Sam, arrived and René shortly after. We nerded out over each others cameras. Especially Yofred's original black paint M4 and steel rim Summilux. The original steel rim. Note the date on this post. Such an amazing kit. And _rare_.

The food at Momoya was super duper good! Mitch, René and I all ordered the matcha french toast. We also ordered a couple basic sushi rolls. Jon and Yofred both got this absolute beautiful looking sushi lunch. I've never had anything quite like this french toast. Can't really describe it. It tasted like matcha but not over powering. Had mung bean paste dollops. I want it again.

After brunch we walked around SoHo for a bit. A greek festival was going on and we just missed Sean (another Leica Discord member.) We met up with Gato after passing by the festival. I don't know Gato's real name, so we're going with her handle. We all headed to Leica SoHo to look at some cameras none of us were going to buy. It was kind of underwhelming but there were some great prints on the wall.

Afterwards we tried to find {{< link href="https://www.instagram.com/jaaphotos/" text="Jean Andre Antoine" >}}, a photographer that's usually on the street making polaroid portraits of people. Our goal was to get a group photo made, but he wasn't in his usual spot. Maybe next time! We decided to go check out Washington Square Park. There was a pretty decent crowd. We did a couple laps but I didn't catch anything of interest.

René and Gato split to head to a block party so the rest of us decided to check out West Village. We stopped into Monster first, but nobody seemed to want to serve us and it was pretty dead so we headed over to Stonewall. Had some drinks on the patio and just chatted for a while. Eventually Jon and Sam had to head to a dinner to meet friends, so we said our goodbyes to everyone and found a train back to our hotel.

Got to our hotel to rest for a bit before getting ready to head to Ty's.

Ty's was a lot of fun. Met an online friend, David, that we've chatted with for years. I had a great time. It was very packed.

Headed back to the hotel and slept like a rock.
