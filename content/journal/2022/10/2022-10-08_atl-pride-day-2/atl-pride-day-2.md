Got up and showered. Headed to Ponce City Market for some brunch and coffee. I had some damn good ramen.

We hit the Beltline to go to the park and may have went the wrong direction at first. But we made it just as things were kicking off. Circled around the venders once. Chatted with the boys at Yeah Buzzy for a bit. I did some street style photos as I did at Charlotte Pride earlier this year. There were a lot of people in really well done costumes and outfits.

We hung out in the park for a bit. The weather was perfect, but the sun was brutal.

After a while we decided to find food. Blake found this place called Triple J's Pizza, which was pretty good. We got a Lyft ride back to the Airbnb and tried to chill for a bit before going to the Eagle.

The new Eagle location is _huge_. And a bit of a maze. And not really finished. And maybe also kind of dangerous? Seemed like a lot of incomplete construction. ðŸ˜… The giant disco ball with a harness was kind of amazing, though.

They had a large area fenced off in the parking lot so that everyone could be outside. All I mostly remember is that it was freezing. I did not bring a hoodie.

There was a food truck in the fenced off area and, well, I was hungry. I ordered some fried okra and french fries, to which they handed me two (2) plates. One completely full of okra, the other, french fries. Let it be known that the best fried okra I've ever had was at the Atlanta Eagle.
