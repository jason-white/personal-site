Mostly a lazy day. Ran some errands. Got an optical cable for the new TV. It works well in case we need to use the antenna or PS5. Figured out my costume, which is Daniel Arnold. Pretty easy. Just bring my camera and dress how I normally do. I wore overalls which seem to be a hit every time. Need to get more I guess.

Dustin absolutely killed it with his Orville Peck costume.
