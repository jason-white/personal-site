Spent the weekend hanging out by the beach with my parents for my mom's birthday. It was very low-key. Went to dinner with some aunts and my cousin. Drove around Wilmington to various shopping destinations. Bought some overpriced pants that I ultimately regretted and returned. ðŸ™ƒ 

Their little spot has a bay behind it with an unobstructed view of the sunset. It's a nice view, for sure. Here's the sunset from the previous day:

Also the first time I got to try a graduated neutral density filter. It worked OK for the earlier phase of the sunset but I wasn't getting the look I wanted as it got darker. I feel like it placed a purple cast on the image but I didn't mind the colors. I promise I only added a small amount of saturation. It was a very vibrant sunset!
