Woke up fairly early and went to Salty Sista's for breakfast. This place is incredibly good. This was the first time we've had the breakfast and whoooaa. If I had a whole day I wouldn't be able to finish that plate of food. Massive pancakes, perfectly cooked eggs and sausage and the grits. Oh my god, the cheese grits. Probably 80% cheese but who cares?

After breakfast we hung out with some family on my uncles dock. While Bill net-fished, Chandler brought his boat in that was having some engine trouble. While my dad, uncle and Chandler were troubleshooting the boat problems I snapped a few photos.

The drive home was OK, it's just really boring. NC is very flat until you make it all the way to the Western side of the state, leaving for little to no scenery.
