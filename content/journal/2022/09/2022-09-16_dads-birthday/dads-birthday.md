Spent most of the morning getting ready to drive to my parents place by the beach for my dad's birthday. Picked up some medications at Costco and it was so busy I had to park at the Lowe's Hardware next door. Never seen it so busy on a Friday. Mitch worked a half day so after around 1:00 we hit the road.

Day one was pretty low-key. We mostly just sat around and talked. There was a nice, as always, sunset over the bay. Dad enjoyed his gifts which were all steel guitar related. He started playing again but currently his guitars are in the shop getting tuned.
