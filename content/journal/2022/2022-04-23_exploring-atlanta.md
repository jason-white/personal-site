We enjoy heading to Atlanta from time to time. The trip down wasn't bad at all. Only somewhat annoying traffic as we arrived, as expected. We checked into our hotel, which was actually an apartment that they rent out for any given number of days. You could stay a weekend, or a few months. Fully furnished and equiped with anything you'd need. _And_ it was less expensive than most mid-town hotels. Score.

It was bear pride weekend but we weren't really participating. We did hang out at Woofs for dinner the first night but that was about it. We heard everywhere else was insanely packed, anyway.

For whatever reason I did not bring my camera to Mary's. That was a huge mistake. Always have a camera on you. _Always_. After Mary's we were introduced to Woody's Cheeseteaks. This is probably the very best cheesesteak I've ever had.

## Day Two

Day two was mostly spent hanging out at {{< link="https://www.poncecitymarket.com/" text="Ponce City Market" >}}. Shopping and eating before walking the {{< link href="https://beltline.org/" text="beltline" >}} to Inman Park for an arts and crafts festival. {{< link href="https://www.yeahbuzzy.com/" text="Yeah Buzzy" >}} had a tent setup and we wanted to support, so we chatted with them a bit and bought a couple goodies. I love my 'Plant Daddy' tee.

Walked the beltline back to Ponce City Market and somehow I got caught up in a street show. I tried to get a good pic of the guy when he flipped over us, but ended up taking a selfie with the guy next to me.

The ride home was nice. Weather was great, traffic was light. Until next time, ATL.
