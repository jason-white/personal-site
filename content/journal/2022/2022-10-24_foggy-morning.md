Never waste a foggy morning. They're kind of rare here, so I grabbed the closest camera and headed over to the park. It's a quick drive, possibly shorter bike ride, but I didn't want to deal with getting the bike down and all that.

There was a crane hanging out and snacking in the swampy area of McAlpine park. I just sat and photographed him for a while. By the time I was done with the roll, the fog was mostly gone.

Was a nice way to spend the morning before work.
