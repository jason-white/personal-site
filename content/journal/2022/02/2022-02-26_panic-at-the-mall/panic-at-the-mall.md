This blurry photograph is the best I could do while trying to panic-escape the mall.

As we were exiting out of Lululemon, walking towards the luxury quad of the South Park mall, we heard a loud _pop_. We saw a security guard take off (in the opposite direction we later found out.) I was a little slow to realize what was going on, but Mitch grabbed me and said "they're shooting!" to which we ran for the nearest exit, followed by hundreds of other people.

It was a bit of a scare, for certain. I should also mention that South Park has possibly the _worst_ designed emergency exit route. Turns out some guy accidentally shot himself in the leg while carrying a gun in his pocket. And that's what we get for being stupid, isn't it?
