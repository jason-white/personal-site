This was a day of pure relaxation. We were going to drive back but why? It was so peaceful at the inlet even though the weather was so-so.

I didn't have my tripod but still waited for a show of a sunset. Didn't seem like it was going to happen so we went to get food. As we walked down to the car I noticed the reflection off my car's hood; blazing red-orange skies behind me. Had left the camera upstairs but I was able to get a quick snap with the iPhone.

As I mentioned before, I didn't have my tripod or any filters so I wouldn't have set up for a "proper" photo, anyway. Sometimes it's nice to just take in that moment without having to photograph it.

Next time.
