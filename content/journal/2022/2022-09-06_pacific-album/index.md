Woke up late and almost missed taking out the garbage cans. Missed my doctors appointment. One of _those_ days I guess. Also, completely stacked with meetings almost the entire day. 

Watched the Apple event which was very good. The UI they've designed for the _Dynamic Island_ is incredible. From a user experience perspective, I can't think of a better use for a screen cuttout. Seriously, b-r-a-v-o.

I don't think I've written about vinyl purchases on this site before. I'm certainly not the wordsmith to write a review, but I wanted to make a post about this particular record (and maybe some others in the future.) This record was finally repressed by the company {{< link href="https://lightintheattic.net/" text="Light in the Attic" >}}. I've purchased releases from them in the past and the quality is always top-notch. As far as I can tell, other than the nice "pacific blue" color of the record itself, it's true to the original. It's Japanese City Pop but made for the beach and was created by three phenominal Japanese composers: Haruomi Hosono, Shigeru Suzuki, and Tatsuro Yamashita. 

I can't recommend this album enough. It's on Spotify and Apple Music now, but was not for a long time. Fantastic background music but also deserves a close listen. Here is a pretty good write-up posted on {{< link href="https://spectrumculture.com/2020/11/09/various-artists-pacific-review/" text="Spectrum Culture" >}}.
