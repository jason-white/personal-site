Nothing hard was planned for this day. We woke up a little later than everyone else. Went around the corner to grab a coffee at {{< link href="https://www.blankstreet.com/" text="Blank Street" >}} and then a slice at {{< link href="https://www.twobrospizzaofnewyork.com/" text="2 Bros Pizza" >}}. Not a bad way to start.

Our friends were in Brooklyn and mentioned a museum which made me think of going to MoMA. So we headed back uptown.

The last time I was in NYC I passed on MoMA and that was a mistake. MoMA is amazing. There's so much there that I didn't realize. It was cool to see pieces up close that you only see in books. To see their mistakes, choices and corrections. The best way to learn to paint is to see how others did it. I was blown away. 

The first gallery we went through, though, was {{< link href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5440" text="Wolfgang Tillmans: To look without fear" >}}. Which made me even more thankful we went on this trip when we did. Incredible work by Tillmans. Also got to see the Frank Ocean portrait which was very cool. _Huge_ print of it! Barbara Kruger had a _massive_ two to three-story installation that covered the entire space from floor to ceiling.

I loved every second of it even though my feet were killing me.

We tried walking around Central Park for a little bit but it rained.

We took a train to the lower east side to get more pizza. This time at {{< link href="https://store.scarrspizza.com/" text="Scarr's" >}}, which was Sherb's recommendation. It wins best pizza I've ever had. Hands-down. We had seconds.

And that was about it for the last day in NYC. Overall it was a fantastic trip and I can't wait to go back. Hell, I'd move there if it didn't mean getting rid of half of our stuff and living in an overpriced tiny apartment. I didn't take a lot of photos. I purposely brought one camera and one lens, which turned out to be a bit of a mistake. I'll be better prepared next time, for sure.
