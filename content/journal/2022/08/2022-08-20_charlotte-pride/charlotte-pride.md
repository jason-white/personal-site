Charlotte's Pride Festival was a lot of fun. Huge turnout! Great weather and good vibes. Thankfully _lots_ of security. I did some street-style run-and-gun photography. It mostly worked. I missed a few poorly zone-focused shots, but warmed up after a while. Anything else out of focus was due to lack of light and me and subjects moving too fast.

I also shot some film during the previous night's happy hour at Crown Station. However, I was shooting in a low-lit bar and accidentally loaded a roll I had finished earlier that night. So yeah, lots of double exposures and no "happy accidents".

The parade also had a really big turnout. And it was _long_. So long.
