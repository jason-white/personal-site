Woke up, got some little things done here and there on the computer while Mitch slept in. We didn't make it to the gym, but we needed to pack and get ready to head to Raleigh.

John and Patrick host a game night at their place. Board games, card games, pool, shuffle board, and many others. There was a good crowd of people and snacks.

I finally learned Catan! Mitch actually bought Catan for my birthday years ago but we haven't gotten anyone to play yet. It's a lot more fun than I expected. I also learned how to play shuffle board. Which is a lot more harder than I expected.
