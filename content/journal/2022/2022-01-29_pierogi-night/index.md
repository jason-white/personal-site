I'm not sure when or how pierogi night originally came up, but it's been talked about for a while now within a certain circle of friends. Honestly not sure if I've ever had pierogis before. Pierogi? Pierogies? The plural form is any of the three according to a quick web search.

My contribution was a meat sauce. I looked up what goes well with pierogis and it's apparently anything. I chose to go with my Mom's recipe. She uses this sauce for her spaghetti and lasagna recipes as well as the occasional stuffed shells. It's very tasty and easy to make.

This is also the first night we cracked open a can of Cougar Gold (_{{< link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS1-4NlhUlc" text="cougar noises" >}}_). Cougar Gold is a cheese from the {{< link href="https://creamery.wsu.edu/cougar-cheese/" text="Washington State University's creamery." >}} I found out about Cougar Gold through some friends in the Leica Discord. Multiple people have tried it and highly recommended it. I'd say it's almost a meme at this point if it wasn't so delicious. We tried the smoked cheddar later and I would highly recommend that one as well.

This could be a lot of fun for future dinners. Maybe pick a new main dish and run with it for each one.
