Started the day off slow. I really wanted to hit some used bookstores but the first one I went to was closed. I wasn't surprised, it's a holiday. Was just optimistic. 

Went back home and worked on some LEGO.

Storms were supposed to be rolling in but it kept holding off. So I decided to drive over to Kings Mountain. I arrived and ended up at a different part of the park that I hadn't intended to visit. But I decided to walk around and make some photos anyway.

It was very quiet, just a couple families walking around and one kid fishing by the dam.

After checking Google Maps I found the farm and drove that way. The light was fantastic, clouds were big and fluffy but no animals.

It wasn't a total bust. I had fun walking around and taking photos.
