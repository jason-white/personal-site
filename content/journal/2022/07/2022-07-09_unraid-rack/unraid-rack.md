The first part of this day was spent at IKEA looking for items to spruce up the guest room with. Most things were out of stock, but we were able to grab some small stuff like shelves, prints and a couple plants.

We walked around for a couple of hours, had some swedish meatballs, and then decided to check out Concord Mills mall. Walked around there for a while before deciding to head back.

I have no photographs from either IKEA or the mall.

I've been working on an {{< link href="https://unraid.net/" text="Unraid server" >}} for a little while now but have been limited on hard drive space. I'm using Mitch's old PC tower and we've misplaced the hard drive rack. So the case only held maybe three drives and a couple of SSD's. Now I'm able to _really_ expand.

Luckily while visting his mom back home, Mitch was able to find another rack we were able to hack into the current case. It worked pretty well!
