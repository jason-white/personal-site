Spent yesterday driving home to visit family. My sisters, niece and nephew were down from New Jersey and I hadn't seen them since their visit last summer. Or was it Christmas?

Also my mom just had surgery on one of her knees so of course I had to check on her recovery, and she's recovering remarkedly well.

Also also my cousin and her kids were in town from Western NC. The whole fam was in town!

We had lunch at Cracker Barrel. I had some pancakes stuffed with cream something, topped with strawberries with a strawberry syrup. Not only all of that, but it came with sausage and eggs as well.

Pushed mom around the mall in her little wheel chair. Walking around for long periods of time is a big no-no.

Got some funny photos of my niece getting her nose pierced. I think she likes it? Picked up a ton of BBQ on the way home to feed everyone that came over later.
