Fun day. The weather wasn't bad...at first! Went to Black Sheep Skate Shop to look at shoes with Mitch. We ate at {{< link href="https://jjsredhots.com/" text="JJ's Red Hot's." >}} Haven't been in a while. It's still as good as ever. It's been much more busy and has expanded to a couple of locations since it was featured on {{< link href="https://www.dinersdriveinsdiveslocations.com/jjs-red-hots-north-carolina.html" text="Diner's Drive-ins and Dives." >}} The recognition is well-deserved as the food is always great.

R & R had a pool party. They invited a bunch of friends they hadn't seen in a while. It was really good to catch up with some people we haven't talked to in maybe six years or so.

It started to rain really hard so everyone shuffled inside. The party continued on for a while. Lots of food and laughs.

Ended the night in bed watching {{< link href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096945" text="Blind Fury" >}} for the first time, and then Conan the Barbarian back to back. Tubi is a heck of a resource for 80s flicks.
