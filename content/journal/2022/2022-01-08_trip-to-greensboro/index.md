We've barely made it up to Greensboro since we moved to Charlotte, which is sad, really. We love it there. Spent the day driving up to see some friends and eat at our {{< link href="http://www.phohienvuong.com/" text="favorite Vietnamese spot" >}}. There are quite a few good Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte, but nothing beats this place.

I took a few photos this day but I'm not really happy with pushing HP5 with Kodak's HC110. Need to try {{< link href="https://beyondtheaperture.com/2021/03/side-by-side-kodak-hc-110-dilution-b-vs-dilution-h/" text="dilution H" >}} or something. Photos are coming out a bit too contrasty.

Pushing HP5 to 1600 in Ilford's own DDX, now that's the stuff. But DDX gets pretty expensive if shooting a lot.
