Woke up, made coffee. Realized the World Cup started 15 minutes ago. Argentina really controlled the first half, but France certainly retaliated quickly. What an incredible World Cup final. Greatest ever, maybe?

We started making Christmas cookies for gifts. I'm writing this several ~~weeks~~ months later, and I can tell you, that we barely gave any away. 

Halfway through, a neighbor is knocking on our door. Neighbors never knock on our door. Turns out we have a busted water pipe that's been leaking for at least two days. Fantastic! All the rain we've had masked it. It was when the rain finally stopped that a neighbor noticed a trail of water flowing down to his yard. That was a fun, unexpected expense. ðŸ™ƒ
