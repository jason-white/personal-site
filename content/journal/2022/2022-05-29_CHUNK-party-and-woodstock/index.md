Drove down to Atlanta to meet some friends for CHUNK party. We went straight to Ponce City Market to look at some clothes and grab a coffee at Spiller Park, a new favorite when I'm visiting. I also grabbed a bag of Juan Jimenez pink bourbon roasted by Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters. Just absolutely delicious coffee. I could smell this bag over everything else. Will definitely be ordering another.

Checked into the hotel which is valet only and someone was blocking the whole entrance with their car. That was fun. We hung out for a bit, then walked to grab some food at a Farm Burger close by. Also, the Adult Swim office was right beside the hotel. Lots of fun things in their windows and a statue of Mr. Poopie Butthole by the door. ðŸ˜†

CHUNK was a lot of fun. I didn't expect to have that good of a time. I stood in the same spot for maybe 4 hours just talking to different people. Not much of a club person these days since I stopped drinking but I'll go to another one of these in the future.

## Woodstock, GA

Sunday we woke up and while looking for some close-by coffee, we found that Momo Cafe was just a block over. A very japanese-inspired coffee shop / cafe. Momo had a great menu for pour-overs and a wonderful selection of pastries. The matcha donuts are highly recommended. Mitch had some sort of insane matcha strawberry latte that had me regretting my pour over, which was also really good.

We explored mid-town for a bit. I only took the GR iii with me on this trip. Purposely so. I don't use that camera enough and decided to just take it everywhere and snap away.

After walking around in the heat we headed back to the hotel to shower and head to Woodstock, GA to see Robbie's cousin's place _Blue Ghost Arcade_. Really cool spot with loads of arcade games. Consoles are scattered about as well as a solid selection of pinball machines.

Woodstock is a nice walkable suburb of Atlanta with lots of shops and restaurants. We enjoyed some bangin' BBQ at Queenies, met a handsome pupper named Jefe, and then for some reason I thought it was a great idea to get a massive piece of pie at Pie Bar. It was peanut butter and oreo. You would have done the same thing.

Our friends went out again that night but we stayed in as we were dead-tired. Walked to Insomnia cookies and then watched TV in bed.

The next morning we hit Momo Cafe again because coffee and matcha donuts. I grabbed another bag of coffee that I certainly didn't need, but couldn't help myself.
