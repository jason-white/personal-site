Over coffee I started to organize house inspiration posts in Apple's new Freeform app. Some how during this, my brain decided to switch gears and I started to think about buying a truck again. There was this one particular silver Tacoma we found in Winston Salem. It had somehow stayed on the lot since the last time we looked, so we decided to go see it. 

We arrived a little late. Fueled by six hours of sleep, not enough coffee and two roller grill...things. Gave the truck a thorough look and test drive. Kind of fell in love with it right then and there. Not 100% into the color but every other box was checked. 

The offer for my trade-in was way better than I expected it to be, so we did the thing. Cannot wait to rig this baby for camping trips in the Smokys.
