The company I now work for does "YOU" days. One Friday a month nobody works. Full company shutdown. Not going to lie, I logged in this morning to make sure nobody was messing with me.

I had a lot of stuff planned but didn't do most of them ðŸ™ƒ. The weather was amazing. Had lunch with Mitch at Kristophers. Sports bars shouldn't have a spaghetti dish that good. 

Ran some errands afterwards. Been looking for more hard drives to shove into my UnRAID server, but Best Buy was fresh out. Went to Ulta to get some supplies to keep my face clean and hydrated. Trying to get into a solid routine and see if it helps. Note: Squalane oil is amazing for your beard.

We had dinner with Matt and Allen at Optimist Hall. We _opted_ (ha) for {{< link href="https://www.harrietshamburgers.com/" text="Harriet's Hamburgers." >}} This is the second time I've had Harriet's and let me tell you they are doing it right. Small, fast, limited options, _incredible_ design and service. This is a perfect example of a new company doing it right. Everything is so detailed down to the green staples they use to close their bags. They have the perfect amount of people working to make sure food is fast and consistent. The line is always to the door.

Afterwards the guys grabbed a beer and I had a very delicious sparkling ginger water from Fonta Flora brewery.

Then, of course, you can't leave Optimist without hitting up Suarez bakery for some treats.
