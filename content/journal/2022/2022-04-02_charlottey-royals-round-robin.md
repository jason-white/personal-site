The {{< link href="https://www.charlotteroyalsrugby.com/" text="Charlotte Royals" >}} rugby team hosted a {{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament" text="Round Robin" >}} today. The weather felt fantastic. And it was really good to see the team play again for the first time in years.

Afterwards we had lunch with Matt and Allen before heading to {{< link href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=third%20half" text="Third Half" >}} later at Sidelines for a bit of Rugby spirit.

Later that night, also at Sidelines, we found ourselves watching the Tar Heels play Duke University in the NCAA Final Four. It was Coach K's last game and {{< link href="https://www.ncaa.com/live-updates/basketball-men/d1/north-carolina-defeats-duke-hands-coach-k-loss-last-game-final-four" text="he took an L." >}} Coincidentally, his {{< link href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2022/02/duke-basketball-north-carolina-rivalry-edition-coach-k-career-tobacco-road" text="first game" >}} against Carolina was also an L.
