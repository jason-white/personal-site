This was a good Sunday. Later in the afternoon we went to {{< link href="https://www.twigsandfigs.com/" text="Twigs & Figs" >}} with Robbie and Ryan for a hanging Terrarium class. I would recommend this place to anyone. Incredibly knowledgable and enthusiastic staff. They teach a basic plants course that I believe we should sign up for as well.

We had a lot of fun building our terrariums, but we also put together this little elephant planter with a couple cactus plants. I love the green and orange.

Also spent some time adding my "New Listens" Spotify playlists to the site. These are playlists of songs that aren't necessarily new to that year, but new to me. Been trying to stay even more on top of it this year.

I've been going through my written journal and photos to update the site. So maybe go back in the archives a little bit to see new posts. It seems like nothing happened in March, but I was just busy starting a new job. Which is going really well and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity.
