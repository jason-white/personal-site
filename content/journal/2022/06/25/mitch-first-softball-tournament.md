Mitch started playing recreational softball last fall. This was an after season tournament that his team asked if he wanted to play in, and they won!

I love how the Summilux wide-open makes the fence melt away.

I hadn't planned on staying the entire day but I was having fun taking photos during the games. We had a little celebratory dinner at White Duck Taco after.
