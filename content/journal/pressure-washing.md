We bought a pressure washer the other day. Well, a few weeks ago at this point. I've been pretty slow to get to film development lately.

Anywho, pressure washers are amazing. Like, *amazing*. I honestly didn't think our driveway was so dirty. Boy was I wrong. You can see a difference at the end of the driveway.

The patio makes me proud to look at. Now if we can just keep up with the flowers falling from the mimosa tree.

On a side note, I really gotta start remembering when I take these photos so I can post with the correct dates. If there's one modern feature film is lacking, it would definitely be EXIF data.
