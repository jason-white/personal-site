A few of our friends (my husband included) have birthdays in January. There are quite a few celebrations. For one of those celebrations our friend Noel comes into town and treats everyone to dinner. Noel is one of the kindest, most genuine people I've ever met. This year his place of choice was {{< link href="https://beefandbottle.net/" text="Beef N Bottle." >}} I've always been told this place has (by far) the best steaks in the city and I now believe the hype.

Beef N Bottle is one of those deceptive restaurants at first glance. From the outside it looks like it hasn't changed or been updated since the 50s. To me this is a _good_ thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The food speaks for itself entirely and we will definitely be back.
