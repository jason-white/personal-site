Started the morning taking Mitch to get new tires before he heads back to PA to visit family. We had breakfast at Stack's, which is always very good.

R&R had a pool party so we relaxed for a bit, and gave each other hair cuts before heading over to their house. The ATL boys were in town. It's always good to see them!

Mitch was pushing up from the bottom of the pool and scraped the top of his toes pretty bad. ðŸ˜–

Loaded some HP5 in the M-A and some Velvia 50 in the XA2. That poor roll of Velvia will probably never be finished. The XA2 acts funny and I rarely use it these days. Time to do a camera purge it seems.
