### Uses

I love reading other peoples 'Uses' pages so I thought I'd make my own. It feels weird to write your own and I'm not entirely sure what to write, but here we are.

#### This Site

This site is built using {{< link href="https://gohugo.io" text="Hugo," >}} a static site generator written in Go. It definitely takes some time to figure out but once you get the hang of it, it's quite nice. This article by {{< link href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/" text="Sara Soueidan" >}} was crucial to helping me figure things out. I'm not really using a _theme_ per se, I'm customizing the look and feel as I go. Everything is written by me. No SCSS, no JS (so far), just a nice and simple website. I'm also getting into Hugo's shortcodes, which are super handy! They can be really simple like a link or figure, but I have the idea to make a gallery shortcode that uses VueJS for a simple lightbox. We'll see what happens.

For hosting and continuous integration and deployment, I'm using {{< link href="https://www.netlify.com/" text="Netlify." >}} When using a static site generator like Hugo, I cannot recommend Netlify enough. You simply link it to a Github repo and whenever you push changes, _boom_ Netlify works it's magic.

Image hosting is handled by {{< link href="https://cloudinary.com/" text="Cloudinary" >}} which I absolutely love. There are lots of things you can do, but I think the coolest is having Cloudinary automatically serve up the best format of an image depending on the end users browser. For instance, if someone is using Google Chrome, Cloudinary can serve WebP, which is a much more compressed lossy image format. And for a browser that does _not_ support WebP it would serve the next best thing, like a JPG.
