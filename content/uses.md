I love reading other peoples 'Uses' pages so I thought I'd make my own.

**Todo**: add an image of my desk.

## Workstation

- 2021 14" MacBook Pro
- LG 5k display. It's kinda busted, but work gave it to me for free. I still want a Studio Display, but this is fine. Apple should make a 27" XDR. Vivo rigid single-arm monitor mount. I've tried multiple articulating monitor arms and disliked all of them. This one is cheap and simple.
- Happy Hacking Pro2 Keyboard - Black on black
- ~~Apple Magic Mouse - Black~~
- ~~Logitech MX Master 3 - Black~~
- Endgame Gear OP1 8k - Black on black. Incredibly smooth, light and most importantly, wired!
- Uplift Commercial standing desk with a 6' butcher block countertop. I love this way more than I thought I would. So much room for activities!
- Old Eames Aluminum Group chair. I've sat in this chair almost every day for 15+ years. Still going strong for a 1986 model.
- PC tower running Unraid as a NAS/media server

## Apps

- {{< link text="Neovim" href="https://neovim.io/" >}} - Text editor of choice for a long time now. And I'm still terribly inefficient with it.
- {{< link text="Ghostty" href="https://ghostty.org/" >}} - Giving this terminal a go after using iTerm for so many years.
- {{< link text="Cloudinary" href="https://cloudinary.com" >}} - Cloud hosted media platform that lets you transform images.
- {{< link text="Lightroom" href="https://adobe.com" >}} - Photo editor of choice. Lightroom smart catalogs is how I organize everything. I can quickly find something by lens, film stock, etc.
- {{< link text="Negative Lab Pro" href="https://www.negativelabpro.com/" >}} - A Lightroom plugin that does a fantastic job at converting digitized negatives into positives.
- {{< link text="Imaging Edge Desktop" href="https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/imagingedge/en/" >}} - This is Sony's tethering tools. It isn't perfect, but it is free. I really just use it to control the Sony A7R when scanning film.
- {{< link text="Things 3" href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" >}} - Things is how I remember everything. Setup for the Getting Things Done method of _getting things done_. I use it all day every day for work and personal.
- {{< link text="Obsidian" href="https://obsidian.md/" >}} - A very good markdown notes editor. New addition to my workflow but I'm loving it. Mostly using Obsidian for keeping track of work notes but will likely incorporate it into personal use soon. I highly recommend checking out plugins and customizing it.
- {{< link text="Reeder" href="https://www.reederapp.com/" >}} - My goto RSS feed reader.
- ~~{{< link text="Yabai" href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai" >}} - Tiling window manager for macOS~~
- ~~{{< link text="AeroSpace" href="https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace" >}} - i3-like tiling window manager for macOS. Still beta. Really nicely done!~~
- {{< link text="Raycast" href="https://raycast.com" >}} - I'm testing out Raycast after being an Alfred user for many years. The only reason I made the switch is because it has window management. It does _a lot_, but it can't even open folders in Finder by default like Alfred, which is annoying.
- {{< link text="Steermouse" href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/" >}} - Shoutout to {{< link text="Chris Glass" href="https://chrisglass.com" >}} for turning me onto this app. Gives you complete control over non-Apple mice. After setting up Steermouse, the OP1 is a _dream_.
