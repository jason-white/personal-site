Here are a select few projects that I have designed and developed over the last three and a half years. This page is purposely not included in the menu of my website. I am not supposed to show internal work, however, that leaves me with no recent work to show future employers.

Each project links to their respective Figma prototype page setup as slides. Thank you for viewing.
